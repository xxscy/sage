The command \"Amal: turn on the TV\" indicates a desire to activate the television.\n  2. The device context shows no specific devices available, leading to the conclusion that the device ID is unknown.\n  3. There are no specific preferences or content to verify since the command is solely about turning on the TV.\n  4. Given the absence of devices, the command is refined to include \"UNKNOWN_DEVICE\" to indicate the lack of identifiable device information while still fulfilling the user's request to turn on the TV."

Step 2 - The identified situation shows that the user wants to turn on the TV, but there is no verifiable match for the specific device. Step 3 - The refined command includes \"UNKNOWN_DEVICE\" due to the lack of identifiable device information. Step 4 - Since the required parameters for device control (specific device ID) cannot be safely defaulted, clarification is needed to identify the correct device. Final Verdict: Need clarification.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The command cannot be executed without identifying the specific TV device.",
