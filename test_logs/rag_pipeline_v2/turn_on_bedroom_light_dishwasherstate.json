The original command specifies turning on a light by the nightstand when the dishwasher is done.\n  2. There are no devices listed in the environment summary, which means I cannot identify the specific light or dishwasher.\n  3. Since there is no information in the user preferences or command history regarding light settings when the dishwasher is done, I cannot provide a specific device ID for the light or the dishwasher.\n  4. Therefore, I have set the parameters for the light and dishwasher to UNKNOWN_PARAMETER, as it is unsafe to infer their identities without additional information."

  "decision": {
    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The user command specifies turning on a light by the nightstand when the dishwasher is done. Step 2 - There are no devices listed in the environment summary, which means I cannot identify the specific light or dishwasher. Step 3 - There is no information in the user preferences or command history regarding light settings when the dishwasher is done, preventing me from providing a specific device ID for either. Step 4 - Since the parameters for the light and dishwasher cannot be safely defaulted, I conclude that clarification is required. Final Verdict: Need.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The specific devices (light and dishwasher) cannot be identified, necessitating clarification.",
