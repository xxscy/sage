The command requests the current temperature of a freezer, but there are no devices listed in the context.\n  2. Since there are no identified devices, I cannot specify a device ID for the command.\n  3. As a result, I must use UNKNOWN_DEVICE to indicate that the specific device is not known.\n  4. The lack of device context leads to a low confidence in executing the command as intended."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The user is asking for the current temperature of a freezer, which indicates a need for device control. Step 2 - There is no verifiable match for the device in the context, meaning the specific freezer is not identified. Step 3 - The command must use UNKNOWN_DEVICE due to the lack of a specified device ID, leading to uncertainty in execution. Step 4 - The absence of device context and the inability to default parameters safely results in low confidence in executing the command as intended. Final Verdict: Need clarification on the specific device.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The command cannot be executed confidently due to the lack of identified devices.",
