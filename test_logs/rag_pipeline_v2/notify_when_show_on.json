The command specifies a notification mechanism (changing the light to red) based on the viewing of a specific show (Jeopardy!).\n  2. The TV guide confirms that Jeopardy! is currently airing on Yes TV, which allows for a verifiable match.\n  3. There are no devices listed in the context, but the command is structured to indicate the action to be taken if the condition is met, thus adhering to the device control rules."

Step 2 - The situation is clear, as it specifies the action to be taken if the condition is met. Step 3 - The content verification confirms that Jeopardy! is currently airing, providing a basis for the condition. Step 4 - However, there are no devices listed in the context, which raises uncertainty about the parameters for device control. Final Verdict: Need clarification on the device setup and parameters for controlling the light.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The command lacks specific details about the device setup required for the action to be executed.",
