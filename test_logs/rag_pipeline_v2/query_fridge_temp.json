The command asks for the fridge temperature, but there are no devices identified in the context.\n  2. Since there are no devices available, I cannot determine which fridge to query or control.\n  3. As a result, I cannot provide a specific command and must set the parameters to UNKNOWN_PARAMETER due to the lack of device information."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The user is asking for the temperature of the fridge, indicating a need for device control. Step 2 - However, there is no specific fridge device identified in the context, leading to uncertainty about which fridge to query. Step 3 - The command cannot be processed without knowing which fridge is being referred to, resulting in the parameters being set to UNKNOWN_PARAMETER. Step 4 - Given the lack of device information and the inability to safely default parameters, clarification is required.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The command lacks specific device information, making it impossible to determine which fridge's temperature to query.",
