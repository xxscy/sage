    "raw": "- Request Type: Device Control\n- Identified Situation: Dmitriy wants to enhance the living room's appearance with impressive lighting.\n- Content Verification: no verifiable match\n- Refined Command: {\"device_id\": \"22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298\", \"command\": \"set colorControl to saturation=100; color=1; switchLevel=70\"}\n- Confidence: High\n- Reasoning: \n  1. The command \"Make the living room look redonkulous!\" suggests a desire for vibrant and impressive lighting.\n  2. The device with ID \"22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298\" has color control capabilities, which can be adjusted to enhance the living room's ambiance.\n  3. The saturation is set to 100, and the color is set to 1 (assuming this corresponds to a vibrant color), with a switch level of 70 to provide adequate brightness.\n  4. There are no specific preferences for the living room lighting in the user's profile, so I used the available device capabilities to create an impressive effect."

  "decision": {
    "raw": "Reasoning: \nStep 1 - The user command is vague and uses informal language (\"redonkulous\"), which does not provide specific details about the desired lighting effect.\nStep 2 - While the refined command suggests a vibrant lighting setup, it does not clarify what \"color=1\" specifically refers to, as color codes can vary by device.\nStep 3 - The command includes parameters for saturation and brightness, but without knowing the user's exact preferences or the context of \"redonkulous,\" the settings may not align with their vision.\nStep 4 - Given the ambiguity in the user's request and the lack of specific preferences, clarification is required to ensure the command meets the user's expectations.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool\nReason: The user's command is vague and lacks specific details, necessitating clarification to ensure the desired outcome.",
