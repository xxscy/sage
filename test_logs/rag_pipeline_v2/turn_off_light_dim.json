    "raw": "- Request Type: Device Control\n- Identified Situation: Turning off dim lights\n- Content Verification: no verifiable match\n- Refined Command: UNKNOWN_PARAMETER\n- Confidence: Low\n- Reasoning: \n  1. The command specifies turning off all dim lights, but there are no devices listed in the context.\n  2. The device context indicates that there are no candidates available for the command, which means there are no identifiable devices to act upon.\n  3. Since there is no information about specific devices or their states, I cannot safely infer which lights are dim or if any exist.\n  4. Therefore, the refined command cannot specify any device IDs and is marked as UNKNOWN_PARAMETER due to the lack of identifiable devices."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The user command specifies turning off all dim lights, but there are no devices listed in the context. Step 2 - The device context indicates that there are no candidates available for the command, meaning there are no identifiable devices to act upon. Step 3 - Since there is no information about specific devices or their states, it cannot be determined which lights are dim or if any exist. Step 4 - Therefore, the refined command cannot specify any device IDs and is marked as UNKNOWN_PARAMETER due to the lack of identifiable devices.\n\nFinal Verdict: Need to use human_interaction_tool\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool\nReason: The command cannot be executed due to the absence of identifiable devices, requiring clarification.",
