    "raw": "- Request Type: Device Control\n- Identified Situation: Setting bedroom lights to a cozy setting\n- Content Verification: no verifiable match\n- Refined Command: Set the bedroom lights to a cozy setting using soft, warm white bulbs at low brightness. If no specific device is available, set to UNKNOWN_DEVICE.\n- Confidence: Low\n- Reasoning: \n  1. The command specifies adjusting the lights in the bedroom to create a cozy atmosphere.\n  2. There are no specific devices identified in the context, leading to uncertainty about which device to control.\n  3. The preferences indicate a desire for dim, warm lighting, which has been incorporated into the command.\n  4. Since no devices are listed, the command defaults to UNKNOWN_DEVICE, indicating that the action cannot be completed without further information."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command involves controlling a device (lights) but does not specify which device to use. Step 2 - The context indicates a desire for a cozy setting, but without a specific device, the command defaults to UNKNOWN_DEVICE. Step 3 - The lack of a verifiable match for the device means that the command cannot be executed as intended. Step 4 - Since the required parameters for device control cannot be safely defaulted, clarification is necessary.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The command lacks specific device information, making it impossible to execute without further clarification.",
