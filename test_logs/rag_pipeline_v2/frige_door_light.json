The command specifies turning on a light in the dining room based on the action of opening the fridge.\n  2. There are no devices listed in the environment summary, indicating that the system does not recognize any devices to control.\n  3. Since there is no information about the specific light or fridge device IDs, I cannot provide a precise command and must use UNKNOWN_DEVICE_ID for the light.\n  4. The lack of device context and preferences leads to a low confidence in executing the command as intended."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command involves controlling a device (the light) based on an action (opening the fridge). Step 2 - There are no devices listed in the environment summary, indicating a lack of recognized devices to control. Step 3 - The command cannot be executed accurately due to the absence of specific device IDs, leading to the use of UNKNOWN_DEVICE_ID. Step 4 - The overall lack of device context and parameters results in low confidence in executing the command as intended.\n\nFinal Verdict: Need\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool\nReason: The command cannot be executed accurately due to missing device information and context.",
