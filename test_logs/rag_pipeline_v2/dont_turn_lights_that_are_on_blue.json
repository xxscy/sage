    "raw": "- Request Type: Device Control\n- Identified Situation: Adjusting lights based on freezer temperature\n- Content Verification: no verifiable match\n- Refined Command: \"If the freezer temperature is below -10 degrees, turn all currently on lights to blue.\"\n- Confidence: High\n- Reasoning: \n  1. The command specifies a condition based on the freezer's temperature.\n  2. The action involves changing the color of lights that are currently on.\n  3. There are no specific device IDs provided, so the command is kept general.\n  4. The command is clear and actionable, adhering to the user's previous command history related to device control."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command involves controlling devices based on a specific condition (freezer temperature). Step 2 - The command is clear in its intent to change the color of lights based on the temperature condition. Step 3 - There are no specific device IDs provided, which means the command is general and could potentially apply to multiple devices. Step 4 - Since the command is actionable and clear, but lacks specific device identification, it may require clarification to ensure the correct devices are targeted.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The command is clear but lacks specific device identification, which may lead to ambiguity in execution.",
