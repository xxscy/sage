    "raw": "- Request Type: Device Control\n- Identified Situation: Adjusting lights based on freezer temperature\n- Content Verification: no verifiable match\n- Refined Command: \"If the freezer temperature is below -10 degrees, turn all currently on lights to blue.\"\n- Confidence: Low\n- Reasoning: \n  1. The original command specifies a condition based on the freezer's temperature.\n  2. There are no specific device IDs provided for the lights or the freezer, leading to the use of generic terms.\n  3. The command does not specify which lights are currently on, so it is assumed to apply to all lights.\n  4. Since there is no device context available, the command is refined to a more general form without specific device IDs, resulting in the use of UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for any unspecified devices."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The original command specifies a condition based on the freezer's temperature, which is clear. Step 2 - However, there are no specific device IDs provided for the lights or the freezer, leading to ambiguity in execution. Step 3 - The command does not specify which lights are currently on, making it unclear which lights should be turned blue. Step 4 - Since there is no device context available and the command is refined to a general form, it results in the use of UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for unspecified devices, indicating a lack of clarity.\n\nFinal Verdict: Need\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool\nReason: The command lacks specific device IDs and clarity on which lights to control, necessitating human intervention for accurate execution.",
