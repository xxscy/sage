    "raw": "- **Request Type:** Device Control\n- **Identified Situation:** User is leaving for work and wants to turn off non-essential devices.\n- **Content Verification:** no verifiable match\n- **Refined Command:** Turn off devices with IDs: ['67ba495a-7982-42f0-a24a-0b1ffcb9e041', '22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298', '363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709']\n- **Confidence:** High\n- **Reasoning:**\n  1. The command indicates that the user is heading off to work and wants to turn off non-essential devices.\n  2. The device context provides three devices, but there are no specific preferences or command history to determine which devices are essential or non-essential.\n  3. Since there are no specific instructions on which devices to keep on, the safest approach is to turn off all listed devices.\n  4. The command is structured to explicitly reference the device IDs for clarity and execution."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The user command indicates a desire to turn off non-essential devices. Step 2 - The refined command lists specific device IDs to turn off, but it does not clarify which devices are considered non-essential. Step 3 - There is a lack of specific preferences or command history to determine which devices should remain on. Step 4 - Given that the command cannot safely default to turning off all devices without knowing which are essential, clarification is required.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The command lacks clarity on which devices are considered non-essential, necessitating human interaction for confirmation.",
