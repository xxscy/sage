The command is asking about the status of the fridge door, which implies a need for device control.\n  2. There are no devices listed in the environment summary, making it impossible to identify a specific fridge or its status.\n  3. Since there are no candidates or device IDs provided, I cannot create a specific command for a known device.\n  4. Therefore, I set the command to UNKNOWN_PARAMETER, indicating that the necessary parameters to execute the command safely are missing."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The user is asking about the status of the fridge door, indicating a need for device control. Step 2 - There are no devices listed in the environment summary, which means I cannot identify a specific fridge or its status. Step 3 - Without any candidates or device IDs provided, I cannot create a specific command for a known device. Step 4 - Since the necessary parameters to execute the command safely are missing, I conclude that clarification is required.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The command lacks the necessary parameters to identify and control the fridge, necessitating human interaction for clarification.",
