    "raw": "- Request Type: Device Control\n- Identified Situation: Setting up lights for St. Patrick's Day with a preference for warm, dim lighting and potential green accents.\n- Content Verification: no verifiable match\n- Refined Command: \"Abhisek: Set up the lights to a dim, warm temperature with green accents for St. Patrick's Day. Device IDs: UNKNOWN_DEVICE.\"\n- Confidence: High\n- Reasoning: \n  1. The command specifies setting up lights for St. Patrick's Day.\n  2. Based on Abhisek's general preference for dim, warm lighting, I inferred that a similar setup would be appropriate for the occasion.\n  3. The addition of green accents aligns with the St. Patrick's Day theme.\n  4. There are no specific device IDs provided, so I used UNKNOWN_DEVICE to indicate that the command cannot be executed without identifying the specific lighting devices."

  "decision": {
    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command is about setting up lights for a specific occasion (St. Patrick's Day). Step 2 - The inferred preferences for lighting (dim, warm, and green accents) are based on general assumptions rather than explicit user input. Step 3 - There are no specific device IDs provided, which means the command cannot be executed without identifying the specific lighting devices. Step 4 - Since the device control parameters cannot be safely defaulted and the content verification is unknown, clarification is required.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: Specific device IDs are unknown, and the inferred lighting preferences may not align with the user's actual intent.",
