The command asks for the current phase of a dish washing cycle, but there are no devices listed in the context that are related to dish washing.\n  2. The available devices (identified by their device_ids) do not indicate any functionality related to dish washing or a dish washer.\n  3. Since there is no relevant device to respond to the command, the command is marked as UNKNOWN_COMMAND and the device_id is set to UNKNOWN_DEVICE.\n  4. The confidence is low due to the lack of relevant devices to fulfill the request."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The user is asking for information about the current phase of a dish washing cycle. Step 2 - There are no devices identified in the context that are related to dish washing, leading to a lack of relevant device information. Step 3 - The command is marked as UNKNOWN_COMMAND due to the absence of a corresponding device, and the device_id is set to UNKNOWN_DEVICE. Step 4 - The confidence level is low because the system cannot fulfill the request without a relevant device. Final Verdict: Clarification is required to identify if there is a dish washing device available.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The command cannot be processed due to the absence of a relevant device, necessitating human intervention for clarification.",
