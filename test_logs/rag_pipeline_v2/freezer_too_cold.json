The user has reported an issue with their freezer being set too cold, which is causing freezer burn on food.\n  2. There are no specific device IDs or preferences available to determine the exact temperature setting for the freezer.\n  3. Since the command lacks specific parameters and there is no device context provided, I cannot safely infer the appropriate temperature setting.\n  4. Therefore, I have set the command to adjust the freezer temperature to a safe default, but the exact parameter remains unknown due to lack of information."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The user has indicated that their freezer is too cold, leading to freezer burn on food. Step 2 - The command attempts to set the freezer temperature to a safe default, but the specific parameter for the temperature is unknown. Step 3 - There are no specific device IDs or preferences provided, which makes it difficult to determine the appropriate temperature setting. Step 4 - Given the lack of specific parameters and device context, it is not safe to default the temperature setting without further clarification.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The command lacks specific parameters for the freezer temperature, necessitating clarification to ensure the correct adjustment is made.",
