Respond with a yes or a no. Device ID: UNKNOWN_DEVICE.\"\n- Confidence: Low\n- Reasoning: \n  1. The command asks if the user can change the color of a light, but there is no specific device identified in the context.\n  2. The device context indicates there are no candidates or devices available, leading to the conclusion that the specific device ID is unknown.\n  3. Since there is no prior history or preferences regarding light colors, I cannot infer any specific settings or defaults.\n  4. Therefore, the refined command includes an UNKNOWN_DEVICE placeholder to indicate the lack of a specific device while maintaining the original intent of the user's request."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The user is asking about changing the color of a light, which indicates a device control request. Step 2 - However, there is no specific device identified in the context, leading to uncertainty about which device the user is referring to. Step 3 - The command includes an UNKNOWN_DEVICE placeholder, indicating that the system cannot determine the specific device to control. Step 4 - Since the device context is unclear and there are no prior settings or preferences to rely on, clarification is required to proceed with the request accurately. \n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The specific device for the light by the fireplace is unknown, necessitating clarification to fulfill the user's request.",
