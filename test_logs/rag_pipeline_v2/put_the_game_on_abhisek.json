The command specifies to put a game on the TV, which indicates a desire for content consumption.\n  2. The TV guide lists a relevant program, \"NBA: TOR vs ATL,\" on channel 7 (TSN 2) at the current time.\n  3. The command does not specify any device context, but since the user is asking to put the game on the TV, it is reasonable to assume the TV is the intended device.\n  4. There are no conflicting preferences or device contexts that would alter the command.\n  5. Therefore, the refined command explicitly states the action to be taken, the device (TV), and the channel to tune into for the desired content."
