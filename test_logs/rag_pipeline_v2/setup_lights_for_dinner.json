    "raw": "- Request Type: Device Control\n- Identified Situation: Setting up lights for dinner\n- Content Verification: no verifiable match\n- Refined Command: set up lights for dinner, UNKNOWN_PARAMETER\n- Confidence: Low\n- Reasoning: \n  1. The command \"Dmitriy : set up lights for dinner\" indicates a request to adjust lighting for a dinner setting.\n  2. The device context shows that there are no candidates available for device control, meaning there are no specific devices identified to execute the command.\n  3. There is no information in the user preferences or command history regarding specific lighting preferences for dinner, which makes it difficult to determine how to set up the lights.\n  4. Given the lack of device information and user preferences, the command cannot be executed as intended, leading to the use of UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for the lighting setup."

Step 2 - There are no specific devices identified to execute the command, leading to a lack of clarity on how to proceed. Step 3 - There is no information regarding user preferences for lighting, making it difficult to determine the appropriate settings for dinner. Step 4 - Given the absence of device information and user preferences, the command cannot be executed as intended, necessitating clarification.\n\nFinal Verdict: Need\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool\nReason: The command cannot be executed due to the lack of identifiable devices and user preferences, requiring clarification.",
