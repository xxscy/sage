Device ID: UNKNOWN_DEVICE\n- Confidence: Low\n- Reasoning: \n  1. The command indicates that the user, Amal, feels the dining room is too bright.\n  2. There are no specific devices identified in the context, leading to the use of UNKNOWN_DEVICE.\n  3. There is no prior command history or user preferences regarding the desired brightness level for the dining room, making it difficult to determine a specific adjustment.\n  4. The command is structured to request a general adjustment to lower brightness, but without specific device information, the command remains vague."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The user, Amal, has expressed a need to adjust the brightness in the dining room. Step 2 - There is no specific device identified for controlling the lighting, resulting in the use of UNKNOWN_DEVICE. Step 3 - The lack of prior command history or user preferences regarding brightness levels makes it challenging to determine the appropriate adjustment. Step 4 - Given the uncertainty around the device and the parameters for adjustment, clarification is required to proceed safely. Final Verdict: Need.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The command lacks specific device information and user preferences, necessitating clarification for safe execution.",
