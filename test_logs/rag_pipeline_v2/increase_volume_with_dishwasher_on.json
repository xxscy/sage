The command specifies increasing the TV volume when the dishwasher is running, but there is no information about the devices available in the environment.\n  2. The command lacks specific device identifiers for the TV and dishwasher, leading to the use of UNKNOWN_DEVICE for the TV.\n  3. There are no preferences or command history related to TV volume control or dishwasher operation, which adds uncertainty to the command execution.\n  4. Therefore, the command is refined to include the necessary action but acknowledges the lack of specific device information."

    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command involves controlling devices (TV and dishwasher) but lacks specific identifiers for these devices. Step 2 - The command's context is unclear due to the absence of verifiable device information, leading to the use of UNKNOWN_DEVICE. Step 3 - There are no preferences or command history that could provide additional context or defaults for the command execution. Step 4 - Given the uncertainty regarding the devices involved and the inability to safely default parameters, clarification is required.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: The command lacks specific device identifiers and context, necessitating clarification to ensure accurate execution.",
