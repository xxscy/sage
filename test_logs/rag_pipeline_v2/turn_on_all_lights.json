    "raw": "- Request Type: Device Control\n- Identified Situation: Abhisek wants to turn on all the lights in a dim, warm setting.\n- Content Verification: no verifiable match\n- Refined Command: \"Turn on all lights to dim, warm temperature.\"\n- Confidence: High\n- Reasoning: \n  1. The command \"Abhisek : Turn on all the lights\" indicates a request for device control.\n  2. The device context shows no specific devices available, but the command history indicates a preference for dim, warm temperature light.\n  3. Since there are no devices listed, I cannot specify device_ids, so I use a general command.\n  4. The command is refined to include the preferred lighting conditions (dim, warm) based on Abhisek's profile.\n  5. There are no conflicting commands or additional context that would affect the execution of this command, leading to a high confidence in the refined command."

  "decision": {
    "raw": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command \"Abhisek : Turn on all the lights\" indicates a request for device control. Step 2 - The refined command specifies turning on all lights to a dim, warm temperature, which aligns with Abhisek's preferences. Step 3 - However, there is no specific device context provided, and the command history does not confirm the availability of devices. Step 4 - Since the required parameters (specific device IDs) cannot be safely defaulted due to the lack of device context, clarification is needed to ensure the command can be executed correctly. Final Verdict: Need clarification.\n\nConclusion: Need to use human_interaction_tool  \nReason: Required parameters for device control cannot be safely defaulted due to the absence of specific device context.",
