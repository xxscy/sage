  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command includes the verbs \"put\" and \"dim,\" the nouns \"game,\" \"TV,\" and \"lights,\" and specifies the location \"by the credenza\" for the TV and \"by the TV\" for the lights. The user is addressing someone named Amal, indicating a request for action.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user wants to watch a game on the Samsung The Frame TV located by the credenza, which implies they are likely looking for a comfortable viewing experience. Dimming the lights suggests they want to create a cozy atmosphere for watching the game, indicating a preference for reduced brightness.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify how much to dim the lights. However, since the user has requested to \"dim\" rather than \"turn off,\" a reasonable default would be to reduce the brightness to a lower level, which can be inferred from common practices for watching TV.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no significant ambiguity blocking the action. The TV is already on, and the command clearly indicates the desired actions for both the TV and the lights. The lack of specific dimming levels can be resolved by applying a common sense default.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear in its intent, and the only missing information regarding the dimming level can be reasonably inferred, allowing for autonomous action without the need for clarification.\n```",
