  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command includes the user \"abhisek,\" the action \"turn on,\" the target \"light by the nightstand,\" and the condition \"when the dishwasher is done.\" \n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user wants to automate the lighting situation by having a light turn on when the dishwasher completes its cycle. This implies a desire for convenience and possibly to have light available when the user is likely to be in that area after the dishwasher is done.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which of the multiple meross Light Strips by the nightstand should be turned on. However, since the user is referring to a light by the nightstand, it can be inferred that they are likely referring to one of the meross Light Strips located there.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity lies in which specific light to turn on, as there are multiple meross Light Strips. However, since all the lights are currently on, the action of turning on a specific light can be interpreted as ensuring that the light remains on when the dishwasher is done, rather than turning it off and then on again.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command can be executed by ensuring that one of the lights remains on when the dishwasher completes its cycle, and the ambiguity regarding which light can be resolved by the fact that they are all currently on.\n```",
