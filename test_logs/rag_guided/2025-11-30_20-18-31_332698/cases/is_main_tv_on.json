  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The user is asking if the TV located by the credenza is powered on. The key elements are \"TV,\" \"credenza,\" and \"on.\"\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to confirm the operational status of the TV by the credenza, which suggests they may want to use it for viewing or are checking if it is ready for use. The context implies that the user is concerned about whether the TV is functioning.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which TV is being referred to, as there are two TVs present. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the user is likely referring to the Samsung The Frame (49), which is positioned by the credenza.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity arises from the presence of two TVs. However, since the Samsung The Frame (49) is the smaller model and is likely the one by the credenza, it can be reasonably inferred that the user is asking about this specific TV. Both TVs are currently powered on, so the answer to the user's question is affirmative.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe user's intent is clear, and the context allows for a confident inference that they are referring to the Samsung The Frame (49), which is already powered on.\n```",
