  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The user is asking about the \"current phase\" of the \"dish washing cycle,\" indicating a desire for specific information regarding the operational state of the dishwasher.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to know if the dishwasher is currently washing, drying, or in another phase of its cycle. However, the context indicates that the dishwasher is in a \"stop\" state, meaning it is not actively washing or in any phase of the cycle. This suggests the user may be looking for reassurance or confirmation about the dishwasher's status.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The user is seeking information about the current phase of the dishwashing cycle, but the retrieved data indicates that the dishwasher is not operating. Therefore, there is no current phase to report. The user may need to check the dishwasher directly for updates, as previously noted.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no ambiguity in the user's request; however, the information available clearly indicates that the dishwasher is not in operation, which means there is no current phase to report. The user's inquiry can be answered based on the current state of the dishwasher.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe dishwasher is currently in a \"stop\" state, meaning there is no active washing cycle to report, and the user's request can be addressed with the information already available.\n```",
