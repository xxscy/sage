  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The user is asking for the current temperature of the refrigerator, indicated by the phrase \"What is the fridge temperature?\" The key noun is \"fridge,\" and the verb is \"is,\" which indicates a request for information.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to ensure that the refrigerator is operating at a safe temperature for food storage. Given that the command is straightforward and there are no indications of issues or complaints, the user is simply seeking factual information.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: There is no missing information regarding the user's preferences or history related to fridge temperature. The current state of the refrigerator has already been retrieved, showing a temperature of 7°C.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no ambiguity in the command. The request is clear, and the necessary information (current temperature) is available.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe user's request for the fridge temperature is clear, and the necessary information is already available, allowing for an autonomous response.\n```",
