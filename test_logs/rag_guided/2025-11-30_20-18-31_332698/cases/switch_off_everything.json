  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command indicates that Abhisek is heading off to work and requests to turn off all non-essential devices. Key elements include the action \"turn off,\" the target \"non-essential devices,\" and the context of leaving for work.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to conserve energy and ensure safety by turning off devices that are not needed while they are away. The mention of \"non-essential devices\" implies a desire to keep essential devices, like the refrigerator, operational.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which devices are considered non-essential. However, based on common knowledge, devices like TVs and light strips are often seen as non-essential compared to appliances like refrigerators.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity regarding which devices are non-essential can be reasonably inferred. The refrigerator is typically essential, and the TVs and light strips can be classified as non-essential. Therefore, the command can be executed without further clarification.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command can be executed based on common sense reasoning about which devices are essential and non-essential, allowing for autonomous action without ambiguity.\n```",
