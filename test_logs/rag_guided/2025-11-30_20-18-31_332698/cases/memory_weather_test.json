  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The user, Abhisek, is expressing an intention to visit his mom and is questioning whether he should bring an umbrella. Key elements include \"visit,\" \"mom,\" and \"bring an umbrella.\"\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: Abhisek is likely concerned about the weather conditions that may affect his visit. The inquiry about bringing an umbrella suggests he is uncertain about potential rain or adverse weather. This indicates a need for weather-related information to make an informed decision.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command lacks specific weather data, such as current conditions or forecasts, which would help determine the necessity of an umbrella. While the refrigerator can provide temperature readings, it does not directly indicate whether it is raining or if rain is expected. The Sercomm device could potentially detect environmental changes, but it is unclear if it can provide comprehensive weather information.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity lies in the lack of specific weather data to inform Abhisek's decision. While I can infer that he is looking for weather information, the exact nature of that information (e.g., current rain, forecast) is not clear. This ambiguity prevents me from confidently advising him without further clarification.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Given the uncertainty about the specific weather information needed and the implications of the user's command, I will opt to call the `human_interaction_tool` for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe ambiguity regarding the specific weather information required to determine if Abhisek should bring an umbrella necessitates clarification to provide an accurate response.\n```",
