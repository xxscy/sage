  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command \"Dmitriy : darken the entire house\" contains the verb \"darken,\" the noun \"house,\" and the modifier \"entire,\" indicating a desire to reduce the overall brightness in the home.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user, Dmitriy, is likely seeking to create a darker environment in the house, possibly for relaxation, watching a movie, or preparing for bedtime. The context suggests that the user wants to adjust the lighting to a lower level, which aligns with the retrieved preference of darkening the house.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: There is no missing information regarding the devices to be controlled, as the available light strips have been identified, and their current states (brightness levels) are known. The command is clear in its intent to darken the house, and the necessary actions to achieve this are straightforward.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no ambiguity blocking the execution of the command. The identified light strips can be turned on and their brightness adjusted to the lowest setting, fulfilling the user's request without any conflicting interpretations.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear and actionable based on the retrieved device states and user preferences, allowing for the execution of the task without needing further clarification.\n```",
