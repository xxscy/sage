  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command consists of the verb \"turn off,\" the noun \"lights,\" and the adjective \"dim,\" indicating a specific action to be taken on a subset of lights based on their brightness level.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user, Dmitriy, wants to turn off all lights that are considered \"dim.\" The context implies that the user is likely trying to save energy or create a more comfortable environment by eliminating lights that are not providing sufficient brightness. The command suggests a focus on the current state of the lights, specifically those that are not adequately lit.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify what constitutes \"dim,\" which introduces a potential gap in understanding. However, based on the retrieved device states, two light strips have switch levels of 48 and 35, which can reasonably be inferred as dim compared to the other light strip with a level of 70. A common threshold for dim lights could be inferred as below 50.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity regarding the definition of \"dim\" can be resolved by applying common sense reasoning, as the two identified light strips (levels 48 and 35) are clearly dimmer than the one at level 70. There are no multiple plausible interpretations remaining that would block action.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear in its intent to turn off lights that are dim, and the context provides sufficient information to infer that lights with levels below 50 are considered dim, allowing for autonomous action without needing clarification.\n```",
