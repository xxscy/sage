  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command \"Abhisek: Start the dishwasher\" contains the verb \"start,\" the noun \"dishwasher,\" and the user's name \"Abhisek,\" indicating a direct request to activate the dishwasher.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user, Abhisek, is likely trying to initiate the washing cycle of the Samsung dishwasher, which is currently off. The command implies a desire for the dishwasher to begin its operation, possibly due to a need for clean dishes or a routine cleaning task.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify the washing cycle or any additional options (like drying or specific settings). However, the dishwasher's current state is off, and it has an express washing course available. This suggests that the default action would be to start the dishwasher using the express cycle unless otherwise specified.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no significant ambiguity in the command. The target device (the dishwasher) and the action (to start it) are clear. The lack of specific cycle preference can be reasonably inferred to default to the express cycle, which is a common choice for quick cleaning.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear and actionable; the intent to start the dishwasher is straightforward, and the default express cycle can be inferred without needing further clarification.\n```",
