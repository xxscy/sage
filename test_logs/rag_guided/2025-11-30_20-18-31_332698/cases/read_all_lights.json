  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The user is asking if all the lights are on, which involves the nouns \"lights\" and the verb \"are\" indicating a state of being. The command is straightforward and seeks a binary response regarding the status of the lights.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to confirm the operational status of all light devices in their environment. Given that the user is inquiring about the lights, it implies they may be preparing for an activity that requires adequate lighting or are simply checking to ensure everything is functioning as expected.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which lights the user is referring to, but the context indicates that there are multiple meross Light Strips that are currently powered on. Since the command is about the status of all lights, I can infer that the user is referring to the identified light strips.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no significant ambiguity in the command. The context provides clear information that all identified meross Light Strips are indeed on. The user’s question can be answered directly based on the retrieved device states.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command can be answered directly based on the current state of the light devices, which indicates that all identified lights are on.\n```",
