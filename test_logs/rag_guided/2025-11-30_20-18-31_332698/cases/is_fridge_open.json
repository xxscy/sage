  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The user is asking about the state of the fridge door, specifically if it is open or closed. The key elements are \"fridge door\" (noun) and \"open\" (adjective).\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to confirm whether the fridge door is open, possibly to ensure food safety or to avoid energy waste. Given that the command is straightforward, it implies a desire for immediate information about the fridge's status.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The retrieved information indicates that the fridge door is currently closed. There is no missing information regarding the state of the fridge door, as the contact sensor capability can provide this status.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no ambiguity in the command. The user’s question directly correlates with the available information about the fridge door being closed.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear, and the status of the fridge door is already known to be closed, so no clarification is necessary.\n```",
