  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command includes the verb \"lower,\" the noun \"volume,\" and the phrase \"by the light,\" which is ambiguous. The user is addressing the assistant, \"Amal,\" indicating a request for action regarding the TV's volume.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to lower the volume of the TV, possibly in response to a loud environment or to create a more comfortable listening level. The phrase \"by the light\" is unclear; it could imply a specific volume level related to the brightness of the lights or a metaphorical expression indicating a gentle adjustment.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command lacks clarity on what \"by the light\" specifically means. It does not specify how much to lower the volume, which could be inferred as a moderate adjustment. However, without a clear reference, this remains ambiguous.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity surrounding \"by the light\" is significant and cannot be resolved through the available context or common sense. It could imply a specific volume level or a general instruction to lower the volume, but without further clarification, it is uncertain.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Given the ambiguity regarding the phrase \"by the light,\" which is critical to executing the command accurately, I will need to call the `human_interaction_tool` for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe phrase \"by the light\" introduces ambiguity that cannot be resolved through inference, making it necessary to ask the user for clarification to ensure the correct action is taken.\n```",
