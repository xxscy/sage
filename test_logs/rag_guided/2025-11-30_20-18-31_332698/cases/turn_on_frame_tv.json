  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command consists of the action \"turn on,\" the target device \"the Frame TV,\" and the parameter \"to Channel 5.\" The user is explicitly requesting to power on the Samsung The Frame TV and set it to a specific channel.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to watch a program on Channel 5, which is associated with the Food Network featuring Jamie Oliver. The command implies that the user is ready to engage with the TV and is looking for specific content to watch, indicating a desire for entertainment or cooking inspiration.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: There is no missing information regarding the action or the target device, as both are clearly specified. The command is straightforward, and the context indicates that the Frame TV is already powered on, but the channel needs to be set.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no ambiguity in the command. The user has clearly indicated which TV to turn on and to which channel it should be set. The command aligns with the capabilities of the device, and there are no conflicting interpretations.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear and actionable, with all necessary information provided to turn on the Frame TV and set it to Channel 5 without any ambiguity.\n```",
