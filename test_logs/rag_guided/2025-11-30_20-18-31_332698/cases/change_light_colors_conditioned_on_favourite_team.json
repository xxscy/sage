  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command involves changing the lights in specific locations (by the TV, dining room, and fireplace) to represent Abhisek's favorite hockey team, which is the Montreal Canadiens. Key verbs include \"change\" and \"represent,\" while the nouns are \"lights\" and \"team.\"\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: Abhisek wants to create an atmosphere that reflects his support for the Montreal Canadiens, likely in preparation for a game or to celebrate the team. Given his preference for dim, warm lighting, it can be inferred that he desires the lights to be set to a warm color and at a lower brightness to create a snug environment.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify the exact colors to represent the Montreal Canadiens. However, common sense suggests that the team colors (red, white, and blue) could be used. The current states of the light strips indicate they are all on, but their color settings are not fully specified for all devices.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity regarding which specific colors to use can be resolved by defaulting to the team colors of the Montreal Canadiens. The command does not indicate a preference for which light strip to control in each location, but since all are on, they can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe user's intent is clear, and the necessary adjustments can be made using common sense defaults based on the team's colors and his preference for warm, dim lighting.\n```",
