  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command \"turn on the TV\" indicates a desire to power on a television device. The user, Amal, does not specify which TV to turn on, as there are two available: Samsung The Frame and Samsung 8 Series.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to watch something on TV, as turning it on is a common precursor to viewing content. Given that both TVs are currently powered on, the user may be expressing a desire to switch to a specific channel or input, or they may be unaware that the TVs are already on.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command lacks specificity regarding which TV the user intends to turn on, but since both TVs are already on, the intent may be to change the channel or input. This gap can be filled by common sense reasoning, as the user might not realize the TVs are already operational.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity regarding which TV to turn on is not blocking, as both are already on. The command can be interpreted as a request to change the channel or input instead. There are no equally plausible interpretations that remain unresolved.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command to turn on the TV does not require clarification since both TVs are already on, and the user's intent can be inferred as possibly wanting to change the channel or input.\n```",
