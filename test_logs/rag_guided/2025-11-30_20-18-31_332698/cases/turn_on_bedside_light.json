  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command consists of the verb \"turn on,\" the noun \"light,\" and the prepositional phrase \"by the bed,\" indicating a specific location for the action.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user is likely trying to illuminate the area near their bed, suggesting they may be preparing for an activity such as reading, getting ready for sleep, or simply needing light in that area. The context implies that the user expects the light to be off and wants it turned on.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which light strip is \"by the bed,\" but there are multiple meross Light Strips available. However, since the planner's plan is to check the state of each light strip and turn on any that are off, this gap can be filled by the existing plan.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity regarding which specific light strip is \"by the bed\" is not blocking because the planner will check all light strips and turn on any that are off. The command can be executed without needing to know the exact identity of the light strip.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command can be executed by turning on the light strips that are off, and the ambiguity regarding which specific light strip is \"by the bed\" does not prevent action.\n```",
