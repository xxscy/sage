  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command \"Turn on all the lights\" contains the verb \"turn on,\" the noun \"lights,\" and the pronoun \"all,\" indicating a desire to activate multiple lighting devices in the home.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user, Abhisek, is likely in a situation where they want to illuminate their space, possibly indicating a transition to an evening activity or a need for visibility. The command suggests a straightforward intent to activate all available light sources, which aligns with the presence of multiple meross Light Strips that can be turned on.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: There is no missing information regarding the action to be taken, as the command clearly specifies turning on the lights. The context indicates that all identified light strips are capable of being turned on, and their current states suggest they are off or on, but the command implies they should all be turned on regardless of their current state.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no ambiguity in the command. The phrase \"all the lights\" can be directly associated with the identified meross Light Strips, and there are no conflicting interpretations regarding which devices to activate.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear and unambiguous, and all identified light strips can be turned on without any need for clarification.\n```",
