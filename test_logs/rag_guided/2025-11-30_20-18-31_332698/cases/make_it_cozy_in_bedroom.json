  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command involves the user, Abhisek, requesting to set the lights in the bedroom to a \"cozy setting.\" Key verbs include \"set,\" and the adjectives \"cozy\" and \"warm\" imply a preference for a specific ambiance.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: Abhisek's intent is to create a snug atmosphere in the bedroom, which aligns with his preference for dim, warm temperature light. The current states of the light strips indicate varying brightness and color temperatures, with some already set to warm values. The user likely wants to ensure all lights contribute to this cozy setting.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which light strips to adjust, but given that there are three light strips, I can infer that all should be adjusted to achieve a uniform cozy setting. The second light strip is currently at a cooler color temperature of 7000K, which does not align with the desired cozy atmosphere.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no significant ambiguity blocking the action. The command is clear in its intent to adjust the lights to a cozy setting, and I can infer the necessary adjustments based on the current states of the light strips.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear, and I can autonomously adjust all light strips to achieve the desired cozy setting based on Abhisek's preferences and the current states of the devices.\n```",
