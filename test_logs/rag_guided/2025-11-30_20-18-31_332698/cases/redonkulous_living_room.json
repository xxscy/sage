  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command \"Make the living room look redonkulous!\" contains the verb \"make,\" the noun \"living room,\" and the adjective \"redonkulous,\" which suggests a desire for a visually striking or extravagant appearance.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user, Dmitriy, likely wants to enhance the ambiance of the living room, possibly through lighting changes, given the context of available devices (meross-Light-Strip). The term \"redonkulous\" implies a vibrant, eye-catching setup, which could involve bright colors or dynamic lighting effects.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command lacks specific details about the desired color, brightness level, or specific actions (e.g., turning on lights, changing colors). However, the context of the available devices and their capabilities allows for reasonable assumptions about achieving a vibrant look.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: While the command is somewhat vague regarding the exact actions to take, the intent to create a vibrant atmosphere can be inferred. The existing device states indicate that some lights are already on, and there are options for adjusting brightness and color. Therefore, the ambiguity does not block action but rather requires a reasonable interpretation of \"redonkulous.\"\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe user's intent to create a vibrant atmosphere can be inferred from the command, and the available devices can be adjusted to achieve this without needing further clarification.\n```",
