  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command includes the verb \"put,\" the noun \"something informative,\" and specifies \"the tv by the plant.\" The user is requesting to display informative content on a specific TV.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to watch something educational or news-related on the TV located near the plant. Given the context, the Samsung The Frame TV is the most probable candidate for being \"by the plant,\" as it is currently powered on and unmuted, making it suitable for immediate playback.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify what type of informative content to display. However, common sense suggests that the user might prefer news or educational programming, which can be inferred from the context of wanting something \"informative.\"\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity lies in which TV is \"by the plant.\" While the Samsung The Frame is likely the intended device, the user has not explicitly confirmed this. However, since it is the only TV that is unmuted and currently set to an input source, it is reasonable to infer that this is the TV the user is referring to.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command can be executed by displaying informative content on the Samsung The Frame TV, which is likely the intended device, and the context allows for reasonable assumptions about the type of content to display.\n```",
