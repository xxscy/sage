  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The user, Amal, is expressing a concern about greasy dishes and is requesting to set an appropriate mode in the dishwasher. Key elements include \"dishes,\" \"greasy,\" and \"set an appropriate mode.\"\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user is likely looking for a washing mode that effectively addresses the issue of greasy dishes. Given that the dishwasher is currently off, the user wants to initiate a wash cycle that can handle this specific cleaning challenge. The mention of \"greasy\" implies a need for a more intensive wash cycle, but the exact mode is not specified.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The specific washing options that would be appropriate for greasy dishes are not detailed in the retrieved information. While the dishwasher has an \"express\" washing course, it may not be sufficient for greasy dishes. The absence of user preferences or historical commands related to dishwashing means I cannot infer the best mode to select.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity lies in the lack of clarity regarding which washing mode is considered \"appropriate\" for greasy dishes. Without knowing the user's preferred settings or having a specific mode recommended for this situation, I cannot confidently proceed with an action.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Given the ambiguity regarding the appropriate washing mode for greasy dishes and the lack of specific user preferences, I need to call the `human_interaction_tool` to clarify which mode Amal would like to set.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe user's request lacks specific details about the desired washing mode for greasy dishes, making it necessary to ask for clarification to ensure the correct action is taken.\n```",
