  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command involves setting the light over the dining table to match the user's weather preference. Key elements include \"set,\" \"light,\" \"dining table,\" and \"weather preference.\"\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to adjust the lighting to create an ambiance that reflects the current weather conditions, which are few clouds and a temperature of 8.9°C. This suggests a desire for a warm and inviting atmosphere, possibly with a specific brightness and color temperature that aligns with the weather.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The user has not specified the exact brightness or color settings they want to match the weather. However, based on the user's past preference for adjusting lights according to weather, it can be inferred that they might prefer warmer tones and moderate brightness, especially given the current cool temperature.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity lies in the specific brightness and color settings desired. However, since the user has a history of adjusting lights based on weather, I can reasonably infer a warm color temperature and moderate brightness without needing explicit confirmation.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe user's intent to adjust the lighting based on weather can be reasonably inferred, and the ambiguity regarding specific settings can be resolved through common sense reasoning about typical preferences for such conditions.\n```",
