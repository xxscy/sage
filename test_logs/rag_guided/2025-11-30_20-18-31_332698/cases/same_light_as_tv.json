  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command \"Abhisek : Turn on the light\" contains the verb \"turn on,\" the noun \"light,\" and the subject \"Abhisek.\" There are no adjectives or explicit parameters provided regarding the type of light or its settings.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user, Abhisek, likely wants to illuminate a space, possibly because the TV is on, which aligns with his preference to have the light on in the same room. Given that Abhisek prefers dim, warm temperature light, it can be inferred that he would want the light to be set to those specifications.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which light to turn on or the desired settings (dim, warm). However, since there are multiple light strips available, I can infer that the first light strip should be turned on first, as it is prioritized in the planner. The absence of specific settings can be addressed by applying a reasonable default based on Abhisek's preferences.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no significant ambiguity blocking the action. The command is clear in its intent to turn on the light, and the context allows for reasonable assumptions about the desired settings.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear in its intent, and the necessary actions can be inferred from Abhisek's preferences and the available device states without requiring further clarification.\n```",
