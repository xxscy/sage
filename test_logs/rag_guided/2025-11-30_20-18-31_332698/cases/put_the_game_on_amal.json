  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command includes the verb \"put,\" the noun \"game,\" and specifies \"the tv by the credenza,\" indicating a desire to launch a game on a specific TV location.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to play a game on the TV that is positioned by the credenza, which is inferred to be the Samsung The Frame (49) since it is the only TV with an active HDMI input (HDMI4). The command suggests a transition to a gaming activity, indicating the user is ready to engage in leisure or entertainment.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which game to launch, but since the user is asking to \"put the game on,\" it can be inferred that they expect the game to be launched on the identified TV. The specific game title is not critical for the action to proceed, as the context implies a general intent to start gaming.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The main ambiguity lies in confirming which TV is \"by the credenza.\" However, based on the context, it is reasonable to conclude that the Samsung The Frame (49) is the intended target. There is no significant ambiguity that would prevent action, as the command's intent is clear.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command clearly indicates the intent to launch a game on the Samsung The Frame (49) TV, which is inferred to be the one by the credenza, and no critical information is missing that would prevent action.\n```",
