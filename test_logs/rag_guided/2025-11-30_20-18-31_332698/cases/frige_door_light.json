  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command includes the user \"abhisek,\" the action \"turn on,\" the object \"the light,\" the location \"in the dining room,\" and the condition \"when I open the fridge.\" \n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user wants the light in the dining room to automatically turn on when they open the fridge. This implies a desire for convenience and visibility in the dining room, likely to help them see better when accessing the fridge. The command suggests a trigger-based action, indicating the user expects the system to respond to the action of opening the fridge.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which of the multiple meross-Light-Strip devices should be used to turn on the light in the dining room. However, since all identified devices are capable of being switched on, it can be inferred that any of them could suffice unless the user has a specific preference.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity regarding which specific light to turn on is not critical, as all devices are operational and can be used to fulfill the command. The context suggests that the user is likely referring to any of the available lights in the dining room, and since they are all on, the command can be executed without further clarification.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command can be executed using any of the available meross-Light-Strip devices in the dining room, and there is no critical ambiguity that prevents action.\n```",
