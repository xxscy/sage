The command indicates a desire for a specific temperature setting, suggesting the user is aware of the optimal conditions for food storage.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: There are no missing parameters in the command; the user has clearly stated the desired temperature. The refrigerator supports the capability to adjust the cooling setpoint, and the current state allows for this change.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no ambiguity in the command. The target device (the refrigerator) and the action (changing the temperature to 5 degrees Celsius) are both clear and supported by the device's capabilities.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear and actionable, with all necessary information provided to change the refrigerator's internal temperature to the specified setting.\n```",
