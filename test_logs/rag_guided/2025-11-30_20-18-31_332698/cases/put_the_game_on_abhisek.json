  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command includes the user \"abhisek,\" the action \"put the game on,\" and specifies \"the tv by the credenza.\" The key elements are the action of playing a game and the reference to a specific TV location.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to watch a game broadcast on the TV located by the credenza. Given that there are two TVs, and the Samsung The Frame (49) is likely the one by the credenza (as it is the only one with an active HDMI input), the user intends to switch to the appropriate input and play the game.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which game to play. However, since the context suggests a sports game, I can infer that the user likely wants to watch a currently available game, such as the NBA game on channel 7.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity lies in which TV the user is referring to, as both TVs are present. However, based on the context that the Samsung The Frame (49) is likely the one by the credenza, I can reasonably infer that this is the intended TV.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command can be executed by switching to the Samsung The Frame (49) and playing the game on the appropriate channel, as the context strongly suggests this is the intended action.\n```",
