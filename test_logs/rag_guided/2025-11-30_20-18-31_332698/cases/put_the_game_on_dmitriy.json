  "rag_reasoning": "```\nReasoning:\nStep 1 - Surface-level analysis: The command includes the verb \"put,\" the noun \"game,\" and specifies \"the tv by the credenza.\" The user is requesting to display a game on a specific TV.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: The user likely wants to watch a sports game, as indicated by the term \"game.\" Given the user's preference for swimming, it is reasonable to infer that the user may want to watch a swimming event if available. The phrase \"the tv by the credenza\" suggests a specific location, but there are two TVs present, creating ambiguity.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The critical missing information is which TV is actually \"by the credenza.\" The user has not specified which of the two TVs (Samsung The Frame or Samsung 8 Series) they are referring to, which is essential to execute the command.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity regarding which TV is by the credenza is indeed blocking the action. While the Samsung The Frame is likely the intended device due to its capabilities, without explicit confirmation from the user, we cannot proceed confidently.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThere is genuine ambiguity regarding which TV the user is referring to as \"the TV by the credenza,\" and clarification is necessary to proceed with the command accurately.\n```",
