  "intent_analysis": "**Intent Classification**: Device Control\n\n**Device Resolution**:\n- **Location cues**: The command specifies the \"dining room,\" but there are no explicit location identifiers for the devices.\n- **Type cues**: The command relates to lighting, and there are three meross light strips available.\n- **State cues**: All devices are currently on, with varying brightness levels (70, 48, and 35).\n- **Multiple devices**: The most reasonable choice is the device with the lowest brightness level (35), as it may be the least bright and thus the most appropriate for reducing brightness in the dining room.\n\n**Parameter Resolution**:\n- The command indicates that it is \"too bright,\" suggesting a need to lower the brightness. The current brightness of the selected device (35) is already lower than the others, but it can be dimmed further.\n\n**Content Resolution**:\n- The command does not specify a target brightness level, so a reasonable default would be to lower the brightness by a moderate amount (e.g., to 20).\n\n**Refined Command**: \"Dim the meross-Light-Strip in the dining room to 20%.\"\n\n**Risk Assessment**: Low - This is a reversible action involving a light dimming.\n\n**Confidence**: High - The intent is clear, and the device context supports the action.",
