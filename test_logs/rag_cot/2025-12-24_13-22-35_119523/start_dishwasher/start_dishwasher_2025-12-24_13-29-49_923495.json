  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it is a command to start a device. Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` does not contain `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` or `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The `Refined Command` specifies the device as a Samsung dishwasher, which is confirmed to be off. There are no markers indicating ambiguity or missing parameters. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The command is straightforward and does not require additional parameters. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since the device is identified and there are no ambiguity markers, I can proceed to execute the command. Step 7 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed without further clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command to start the dishwasher is clear, and the device is identified without ambiguity.",
