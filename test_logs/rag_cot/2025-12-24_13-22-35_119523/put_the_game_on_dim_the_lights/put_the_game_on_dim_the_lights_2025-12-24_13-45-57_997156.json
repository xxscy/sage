  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: The command is not an information request; it involves controlling devices. Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` for the lights, indicating that the target is not resolved. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The command specifies a TV but lacks a specific game or channel, marked as `UNKNOWN_CHANNEL`, and the lights are referenced without a specific device due to ambiguity. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is a Device Control request. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates ambiguity in the light device and an unknown channel for the TV. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since the `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` and `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`, clarification is required. Step 7 - Final Verdict: Clarification is strictly required due to the ambiguity in the light device and the unknown channel.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command contains ambiguous device references and an unknown channel, necessitating clarification to proceed accurately.",

Therefore, the channel is marked as UNKNOWN_CHANNEL. The command to dim the lights is directed at the meross-Light-Strip, but there are two active light strips, making the target ambiguous. Thus, the lights are referenced without a specific device, leading to the dimming command being issued to an ambiguous target.",
