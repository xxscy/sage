Based on your command history, you mentioned that hockey is not fun to watch, which suggests you may not be interested in that sport.

  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it is a command to control a device. Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` does not contain an `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` marker, but it does not specify a game, which is an `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The device specified is the Samsung 8 Series (82) TV, but the command lacks a specific game to play. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is a Device Control request. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates a specific device but lacks the necessary parameter of which game to put on the TV. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since there is an `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER` (the game), clarification is required. Step 7 - Final Verdict: Clarification is needed due to the missing game parameter.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command lacks a specific game to play on the TV, which is a required parameter for execution.",
