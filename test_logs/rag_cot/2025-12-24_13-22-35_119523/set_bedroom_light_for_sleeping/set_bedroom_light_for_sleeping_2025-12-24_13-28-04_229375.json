Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` indicates a device (bedroom light) but contains the `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` marker, indicating that the specific device to control is not resolved. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The command specifies a change to the bedroom light, but due to the ambiguity of which specific light to control, I cannot proceed without clarification. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is a Device Control request. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates a need to turn off the bedroom light, but the ambiguity of the device prevents execution. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since the `Refined Command` contains the `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` marker, I must ask for clarification. Step 7 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required due to the ambiguity of the device.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies a change to the bedroom light, but the specific device is ambiguous, requiring clarification.",

  "intent_analysis": "- **Request Type**: Device Control\n- **Identified Situation**: User is going to sleep and requests a change in the bedroom light settings.\n- **Content Verification**: No verifiable match found\n- **Refined Command**: Set bedroom light to OFF\n- **Confidence**: High\n- **Reasoning**: The user indicated they are going to sleep, which typically requires reducing light levels to promote rest. The current state of the available bedroom lights is OFF, and since there are multiple devices of the same type (meross-Light-Strip), I cannot determine a specific one to control. However, the command to turn off the lights is a safe default for sleep. No personal preferences for light settings were found in the user's history, so I set the light to OFF as a conservative action.",
