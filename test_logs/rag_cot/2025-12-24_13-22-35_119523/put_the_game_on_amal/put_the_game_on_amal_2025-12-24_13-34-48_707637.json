  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it is a command to control a device. Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` contains `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER` as the channel is marked as UNKNOWN_CHANNEL. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The device specified is the Samsung 8 Series (82) TV, but the channel is unknown, which indicates a missing parameter. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates that the device is identified, but the channel is not specified, leading to ambiguity. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since the `Refined Command` contains `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`, clarification is required. Step 7 - Final Verdict: Clarification is needed due to the missing channel information.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command lacks a specific channel for the game, which is necessary to execute the request.",
