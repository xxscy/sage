Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` since there are multiple TVs available. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The command specifies a game to be put on a TV, but the target device is ambiguous due to multiple TVs. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is a Device Control request. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates that the device is ambiguous and requires clarification. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since the `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, clarification is required.
