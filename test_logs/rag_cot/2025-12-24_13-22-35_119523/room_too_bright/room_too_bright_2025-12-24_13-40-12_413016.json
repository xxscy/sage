Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` as there are multiple meross-Light-Strips in the dining room. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The command does not specify which meross-Light-Strip to adjust, leading to ambiguity. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is a Device Control request. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates a need to adjust brightness but lacks a specific device due to ambiguity. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since the command contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, clarification is required. Step 7 - Final Verdict: Clarification is necessary due to the ambiguity in the device selection.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command contains an ambiguous device reference, requiring clarification to proceed with the adjustment.",

However, there is no specific preference for the brightness level provided in the user's history or preferences. The device lookup shows multiple meross-Light-Strips, but the command does not specify which one to adjust, leading to an **AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE** situation. Therefore, I have provided a general command to adjust the brightness without specifying a level, as no preference was retrievable.",
