Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` does not contain `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` or `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER` markers. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The command specifies the TV as the Samsung The Frame (49) and the dishwasher as Samsung, with no ambiguity in the device identification. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is a Device Control request. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The command specifies to increase the volume of the TV by 1 whenever the dishwasher is running, but the dishwasher is currently off, which prevents execution. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since the dishwasher is not running, the command cannot be executed as requested. Step 7 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required because the command cannot be executed due to the current state of the dishwasher.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command cannot be executed because the dishwasher is currently off, and clarification is needed to determine the next action.",

The current volume of the TV is 6, and since the dishwasher is currently off, I cannot execute the command as requested.
