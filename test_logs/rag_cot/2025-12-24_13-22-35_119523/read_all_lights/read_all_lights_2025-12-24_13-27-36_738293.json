Would you like me to check or adjust the lights for you?",
  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: The command is an inquiry about the status of all lights, which qualifies as an information request. Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` does not contain `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` or `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The command is asking for the status of all lights without specifying any ambiguity or missing parameters. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control since it involves checking the status of devices. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is clear and does not indicate any ambiguity or missing parameters. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since this is an information request and does not require any state modification, it can be executed as is. Step 7 - Final Verdict: The command is clear and does not require further clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is an information request about the status of all lights, which can be executed without needing further clarification.",
