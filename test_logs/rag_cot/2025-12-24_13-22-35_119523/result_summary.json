Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is clear and does not indicate any ambiguity or missing parameters. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since this is an information request and does not require any state modification, it can be executed as is. Step 7 - Final Verdict: The command is clear and does not require further clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is an information request about the status of all lights, which can be executed without needing further clarification.",

Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` contains the `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` marker, indicating that there are multiple devices that could be considered non-essential. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The command specifies turning off non-essential devices, but the ambiguity regarding which devices to turn off remains unresolved due to the presence of the `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` marker. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates that there are multiple devices (two meross-Light-Strips) that are currently on, leading to ambiguity. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since the `Refined Command` contains the `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` marker, clarification is required. Step 7 - Final Verdict: Clarification is necessary due to the ambiguity in the command regarding which non-essential devices to turn off.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command contains an ambiguity regarding which non-essential devices to turn off, requiring clarification.",

The current channel on the Samsung 8 Series (82) is channel 7, but since the user did not specify which channel to move, it cannot be verified. The command to turn off the Samsung 8 Series (82) is clear, but the channel movement lacks a verifiable source, leading to a low confidence in the command's execution.

Target: AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE.\"\n- **Confidence**: Low (Unverified Content/Ambiguous Target)\n- **Reasoning**: The user requested to turn off all dim lights. There are multiple light strips with varying brightness levels (20 and 90). Since the command implies a singular target but multiple devices exist, I marked the target as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. There is no specific command history or preference related to dimming lights or turning them off, and thus no verifiable match was found.",
