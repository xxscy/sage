Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The device specified is \"meross-Light-Strip,\" but it is ambiguous due to multiple instances. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is a Device Control request. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates ambiguity in the device, which requires clarification.
