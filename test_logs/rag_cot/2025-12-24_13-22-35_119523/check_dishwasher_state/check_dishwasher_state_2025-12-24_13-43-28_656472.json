Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` does not contain `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` or `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The device specified is the Samsung dishwasher, and there are no markers indicating ambiguity or missing parameters. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is a Device Control request. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is clear and specifies the device without ambiguity. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since the command is an information request and the device is identified, it can be executed without further inquiry. Step 7 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed as is.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is a straightforward information request about the current phase of the dishwashing cycle, and the device is clearly identified.",

The Samsung dishwasher is the only device identified, and its state is currently on. However, the specific phase of the cycle is not available in the provided device state information, leading to the conclusion that the command should be issued to retrieve that information.",
