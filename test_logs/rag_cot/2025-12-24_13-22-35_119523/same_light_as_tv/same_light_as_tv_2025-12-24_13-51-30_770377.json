  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it is a command to control a device. Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, indicating that the target device is not clearly identified. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The `Refined Command` specifies a light but does not clarify which one, leading to ambiguity. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is a Device Control request. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates that the device is ambiguous, which requires clarification. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since the command contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, I must ask for clarification. Step 7 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required due to the ambiguous device status.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies an ambiguous device, requiring clarification to proceed with the action.",

Additionally, there are multiple active light devices (meross-Light-Strip) without a clear indication of which one to control, leading to the classification of the target as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE.",
