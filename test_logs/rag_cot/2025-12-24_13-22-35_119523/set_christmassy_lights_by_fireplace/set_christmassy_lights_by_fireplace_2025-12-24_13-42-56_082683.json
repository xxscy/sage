You could also consider adding some festive decorations like garlands or stockings. If you have any holiday-themed music or shows, playing those could enhance the atmosphere. Would you like me to suggest specific lighting settings or decorations?",
  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it is a command to set a mood. Step 2 - Check Intent Analysis Markers: The `Refined Command` contains an `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` marker, indicating that the target device is not clearly identified. Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The command implies a lighting adjustment but does not specify which meross-Light-Strip to use, leading to ambiguity. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is a Device Control request. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates an ambiguous device and missing parameters. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since the command contains the `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` marker, clarification is required. Step 7 - Final Verdict: Clarification is necessary due to the ambiguous device reference.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command contains an ambiguous device reference, requiring clarification to proceed accurately.",

The device lookup revealed multiple meross-Light-Strip devices, but the command implies a singular reference without a clear target, leading to an **AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE** situation. The lighting level of 70 was chosen as a conservative default based on the current state of one of the active devices. However, the specific color settings (red and green accents) are marked as `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER` since they were not explicitly defined in the device capabilities or user preferences.",
