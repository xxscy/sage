Step 3 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The command specifies a light by the bed, but the specific device is ambiguous. Step 4 - Classify Intent: This is a Device Control request. Step 5 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates that the device is ambiguous, which requires clarification. Step 6 - Apply Logic: Since the `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, I must ask for clarification.

There are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices available, but the specific one to control is ambiguous as the command does not specify which one. Therefore, I cannot definitively identify a single target device, marking it as **AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE**. The command is issued to turn on the light, but without a specific preference for color or brightness, I have used a conservative approach to simply turn on the light without specifying parameters.",
