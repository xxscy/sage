Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates a need to dim the lights, and no specific brightness level is provided. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Since the `Refined Command` specifies a device, device ambiguity is resolved, and I can proceed to dim the lights without needing further clarification.
