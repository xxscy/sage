Step 2 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The `Refined Command` specifies turning off all non-essential devices, which includes the two \"meross-Light-Strip\" devices that are currently on. Device ambiguity is resolved as the command is clear. Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is clear and actionable, with no ambiguity regarding the devices to be controlled. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Logic 2 applies here, and since the command specifies the devices to turn off, device ambiguity is resolved. Step 6 - Final Verdict: No clarification is needed as the command is straightforward and actionable.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear and specifies the devices to be turned off, with no ambiguity present.",
