Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is actionable and specifies the device to be controlled. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Since the `Refined Command` specifies a device, device ambiguity is resolved, and the command can be executed as intended. Step 6 - Final Verdict: The command is clear and actionable without needing further clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies a device to control and is actionable based on the state of another device, with no ambiguity present.",
