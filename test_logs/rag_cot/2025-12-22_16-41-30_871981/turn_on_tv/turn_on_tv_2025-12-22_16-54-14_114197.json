Step 2 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The `Refined Command` specifies \"Turn on the TV,\" but does not clarify which TV, indicating device ambiguity is not resolved. Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` does not specify which TV to turn on, leading to ambiguity. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Since there are multiple TVs and the command does not specify which one, I must ask for clarification. Step 6 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required due to the ambiguity of which TV to turn on.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command does not specify which TV to turn on, leading to ambiguity that requires clarification.",

The device state indicates that one TV is already on, while the other is off. Since the user did not specify which TV to turn on and there is ambiguity due to multiple devices, I marked the command as `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`.",
