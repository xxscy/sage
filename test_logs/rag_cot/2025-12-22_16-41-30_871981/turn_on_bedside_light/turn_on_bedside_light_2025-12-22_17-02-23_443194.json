Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` clearly states the action to be taken with a specific device. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Since the `Refined Command` specifies a device, device ambiguity is resolved, and I can proceed with the action. Step 6 - Final Verdict: No further clarification is needed as the command is clear and actionable.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies a device, and device ambiguity is resolved, allowing for direct execution of the command.",
