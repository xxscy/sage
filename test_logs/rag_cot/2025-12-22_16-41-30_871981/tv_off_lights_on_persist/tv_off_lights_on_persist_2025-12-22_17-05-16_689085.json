Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is clear and actionable, specifying the devices involved. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Since the command specifies the TV and the light, device ambiguity is resolved, and the command can be executed as intended. Step 6 - Final Verdict: The command is clear and does not require further clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies the devices clearly, allowing for direct execution without ambiguity.",

The TV is currently off, and the light's state is off as well. Since there is no specific channel mentioned in the command, I did not attempt to verify any content consumption, as the focus is on device control. The command is clear and actionable based on the current state of the devices.",
