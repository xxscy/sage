Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command involves device control and the parameters are ambiguous, I will apply conservative defaults for a sleep-friendly environment. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed with inferred defaults without needing clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command can be reasonably completed by applying safe defaults for a sleep-friendly light setting without requiring user interaction.",

Check the current state of all meross-Light-Strip devices to ensure they are on.\n2. If any of the devices are off, turn them on using the `switch` capability.\n3. Set the color temperature to a warmer value suitable for sleep mode using the `colorTemperature` capability.\n4. Optionally, adjust the brightness level using the `switchLevel` capability to a lower setting for a more relaxing environment.\nPlanner notes: Since the user did not specify which bedroom light to change, I have included all available meross-Light-Strip devices. The plan involves checking their current state and adjusting the color temperature and brightness to create a sleep-friendly atmosphere. Further disambiguation may be required if the user has a specific light in mind. \n<FINISHED>",
