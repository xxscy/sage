Step 2 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control since it involves checking the status of devices. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates a need to check the status of all lights and turn on any that are off. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Logic 0 applies here as the command primarily seeks to retrieve information about the state of the lights. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Since the command is an information request, it does not require further action.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is an information request about the status of the lights, which can be completed as-is without needing further clarification or action.",
