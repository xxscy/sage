If you want to completely turn off the first TV, you may need to use the `switch` capability instead of `audioMute`, but since the command specifically mentioned turning off the audio, I used `audioMute`. If further clarification is needed on whether to completely power off the first TV, please specify. \n<FINISHED>",
