Step 2 - Classify Intent: The intent is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates a specific TV but lacks a specified game, marked as UNKNOWN_PARAMETER. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the specific game is unknown and no reasonable default can be inferred, I must ask for clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required due to the unknown game parameter.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command lacks a specified game, which is necessary to complete the action.",
