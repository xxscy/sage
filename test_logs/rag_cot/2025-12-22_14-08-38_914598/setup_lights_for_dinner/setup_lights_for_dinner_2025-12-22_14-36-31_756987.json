  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it involves controlling devices. Step 2 - Classify Intent: The request is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` specifies turning on all meross-Light-Strip devices and setting brightness to 50%, which is a reasonable default for a dinner ambiance. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command specifies a clear action and context, I can proceed without needing clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed as it stands.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies clear actions for device control with reasonable defaults applied for brightness and ambiance.",

Optionally, set color temperature to 2700K for a warm atmosphere.\n- **Confidence**: High\n- **Reasoning**: The command involves controlling the lights to create a suitable environment for dinner. Since the user did not specify a personal preference for brightness or color, I applied a conservative default of turning on the lights and setting the brightness to 50%. The color temperature was suggested to be around 2700K, which is typical for a cozy dinner setting. All available meross-Light-Strip devices will be controlled to ensure a consistent ambiance.",
