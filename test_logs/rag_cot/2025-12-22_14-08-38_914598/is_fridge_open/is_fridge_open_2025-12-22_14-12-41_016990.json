Step 2 - Classify Intent: The request is classified as Device Control since it involves checking the state of a device (the fridge door). Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates executing the contact sensor capability on the refrigerator to check if the door is open. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command is an information request about the device state, it falls under Logic 0, which means it does not require further action or clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed directly to check the fridge door status.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is an information request about the fridge door status, which can be executed directly without needing further clarification.",
