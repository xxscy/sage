Step 2 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control since it involves querying the state of a device. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is \"Get the current temperature from the Samsung refrigerator,\" which is clear and specific. Step 4 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 0, this is an information request, so it does not require further action or clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Since the command is a straightforward request for information about the fridge's temperature, it can be executed as is.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is a direct information request about the fridge's temperature, which can be fulfilled without needing further clarification.",
