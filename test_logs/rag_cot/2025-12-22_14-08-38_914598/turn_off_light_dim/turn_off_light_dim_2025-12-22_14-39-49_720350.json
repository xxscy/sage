  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it is a command to change the state of devices. Step 2 - Classify Intent: The request is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` specifies turning off all lights with a switch level below 50, which is a clear action. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command specifies a threshold for dim lights and the context provides a clear action to take, I can proceed without needing further clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed based on the inferred threshold for dim lights.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies a clear action based on a reasonable default threshold for dim lights, allowing for execution without further inquiry.",

The current state of the lights was checked, revealing three light strips with varying switch levels (20, 90, and 20). A threshold of 50 was applied to determine which lights are considered \"dim.\" Since there are no specific preferences or command history related to dimming lights, a conservative default threshold was used to identify dim lights. The command specifies turning off all lights below this threshold.",
