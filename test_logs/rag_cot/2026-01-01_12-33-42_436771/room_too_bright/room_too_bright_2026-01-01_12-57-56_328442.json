  "intent_analysis": "**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Intent Classification**: The command \"It is too bright in the dining room\" indicates a need for device control, specifically adjusting the lighting in the dining room.\n\n2. **Device Resolution**:\n   - **Location Cues**: The command specifies the dining room, but there are no explicit location tags for the devices.\n   - **Type Cues**: The available devices are all meross Light Strips, which can control brightness.\n   - **State Cues**: The current brightness levels of the devices are:\n     - Device 1: 70%\n     - Device 2: 48%\n     - Device 3: 35%\n   - Since the command is about reducing brightness, the device with the highest brightness (70%) is the most relevant for adjustment.\n\n3. **Parameter Resolution**: The command does not specify how much to dim the lights. Given that the current level is 70%, a reasonable adjustment would be to lower it to a more comfortable level, such as 50%.\n\n4. **Content Resolution**: The command does not involve content selection, as it is focused on device control.\n\n**Resolution Rules**:\n- **Device Not Found**: All devices are accounted for.\n- **Multiple Options**: The device with the highest brightness (70%) will be selected for adjustment.\n- **Unclear Parameters**: A safe default of reducing the brightness to 50% will be inferred.\n- **Content Selection**: Not applicable in this context.\n\n**Risk Levels**: The action involves adjusting lighting, which is reversible and thus categorized as low risk.\n\n**Output**:\n- **Refined Command**: \"Dim the meross-Light-Strip in the dining room to 50%.\"\n- **Risk Assessment**: Low\n- **Confidence**: High",
