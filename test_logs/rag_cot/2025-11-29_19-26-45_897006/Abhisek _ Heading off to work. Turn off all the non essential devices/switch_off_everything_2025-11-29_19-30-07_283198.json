The c2c-switch is capable of switching on and off, while the meross Light Strips have capabilities for switching, adjusting brightness (switchLevel), and color control. The Samsung TVs are likely used for entertainment, and the refrigerator and dishwasher are essential kitchen appliances.\n\n2) The current states of the devices indicate that the c2c-switch is off, while the first meross Light Strip is set to a brightness level of 70, and the second Light Strip is at 48. The refrigerator's refrigeration capability needs to be turned off, and the dishwasher's operating state must be checked to ensure it is not running. Actionable controls include switching off the c2c-switch and Light Strips, turning off the refrigeration for the refrigerator, and stopping the dishwasher if it is currently operational.",
