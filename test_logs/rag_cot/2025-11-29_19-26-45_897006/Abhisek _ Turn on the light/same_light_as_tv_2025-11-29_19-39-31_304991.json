  "environment_overview": "1) The detected devices include multiple meross-Light-Strips, each capable of switching on/off, adjusting brightness (switchLevel), and controlling color (colorControl). The specific devices identified are: meross-Light-Strip (22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298), meross-Light-Strip (363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709), and meross-Light-Strip (571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d). These devices are likely located in a common area where lighting control is needed.\n\n2) The current states of the devices indicate that two of the meross-Light-Strips are already switched on, while one is off. The switch levels for the active devices are at 70 and 35, respectively, while the third device has a switch level of 48. The c2c-switch is currently off, and other devices such as the Samsung TVs and dishwasher are also off. Actionable controls include turning on the off devices using their switch capabilities, with the option to adjust brightness and color settings as needed.",
