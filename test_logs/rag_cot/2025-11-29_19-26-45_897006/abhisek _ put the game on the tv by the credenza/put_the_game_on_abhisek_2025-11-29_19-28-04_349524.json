  "environment_overview": "1) Two TVs have been detected in the environment: the Samsung The Frame (49) and the Samsung 8 Series (82). The Samsung The Frame is likely positioned by the credenza, as it is currently powered on and set to HDMI4, which is a common input for gaming. The Samsung 8 Series, on the other hand, is powered off and set to digital TV input, indicating it is not currently in use.\n\n2) The Samsung The Frame (49) is powered on with a volume level of 6 and is unmuted, allowing for immediate audio playback. It is set to HDMI4, which is suitable for launching the game. The Samsung 8 Series (82) is powered off, with a volume of 0 and muted, meaning it requires power activation and input source adjustment to be utilized. Actionable controls for the Samsung The Frame include switching to the game input and starting playback, while the Samsung 8 Series needs to be powered on and set to the appropriate input to be functional.",
