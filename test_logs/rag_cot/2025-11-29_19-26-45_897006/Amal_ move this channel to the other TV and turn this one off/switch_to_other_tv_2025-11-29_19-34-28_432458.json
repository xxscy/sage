Both devices are equipped with capabilities for audio control, channel management, and power operations.\n\n2) The current state of the Samsung The Frame TV does not have a specified channel, while the Samsung 8 Series TV is currently set to channel 7. Both TVs can be powered on or off, and their audio volume can be adjusted or muted. The Frame TV is connected to HDMI4, while the 8 Series is using the digital TV input source. The user command indicates a desire to move the channel from the 8 Series to The Frame and turn off the 8 Series TV.",
