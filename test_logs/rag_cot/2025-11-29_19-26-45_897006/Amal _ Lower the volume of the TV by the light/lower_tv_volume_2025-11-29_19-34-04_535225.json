Additionally, there are multiple light strips present, which can also be controlled for brightness and color temperature.\n\n2) The current volume levels for the TVs are 6 for the Samsung The Frame and 50 for the Samsung 8 Series. Both TVs can have their volume lowered using the audioVolume capability. The light strips are currently on, with varying brightness levels: one at 70, another at 48, and two at 35. The light strips can be adjusted for brightness and color temperature as needed.",
