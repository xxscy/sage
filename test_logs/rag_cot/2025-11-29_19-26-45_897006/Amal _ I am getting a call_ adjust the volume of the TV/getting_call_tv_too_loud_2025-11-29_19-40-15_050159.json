  "environment_overview": "1) Two TVs have been detected in the environment: the Samsung The Frame (49) and the Samsung 8 Series (82). Both devices support capabilities such as audio volume adjustment, power control, and media playback commands. The Samsung The Frame is currently set to HDMI4 as its input source, while the Samsung 8 Series is using digital TV as its input source.\n\n2) The current volume levels for the TVs are 6 for the Samsung The Frame and 75 for the Samsung 8 Series. Both TVs are capable of being powered on via OCF if they are off. The Samsung The Frame is in a state that supports media playback commands, while the Samsung 8 Series is also ready for media playback. Actionable controls include adjusting the volume for either TV, depending on which one is currently powered on.",
