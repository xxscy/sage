These devices are capable of switching on/off, adjusting brightness (switchLevel), and controlling color settings (colorTemperature and colorControl). Additionally, there are Samsung TVs (The Frame and 8 Series) and a Samsung refrigerator, which also have switching capabilities.\n\n2) The current states of the devices indicate that all meross Light Strips are currently off, while the Samsung TVs and refrigerator are on. The actionable control for the light strips is to execute the switch command to turn them on. The TVs and refrigerator are already powered on, and no further action is required for them at this time. The focus is on activating the light strips to fulfill the user command.",
