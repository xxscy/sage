The user request is to \"put something informative on the tv by the plant.\" The context suggests that the user is likely referring to a TV that is currently on and accessible. \n2. There are two TVs identified: the Samsung The Frame (49) and the Samsung 8 Series (82). The command does not specify which TV to use, leading to ambiguity.\n3. The Samsung 8 Series TV is currently on, while the Samsung The Frame TV is off. Given that the user wants to display something informative, it is reasonable to assume they would prefer the TV that is already on.\n4. However, the phrase \"by the plant\" does not explicitly indicate which TV is closer to the plant, creating uncertainty about which device the user is referring to.\n5. The ambiguity score is high because the user did not specify which TV they meant, and both TVs are active in the environment. The risk is low since turning on a TV and selecting a channel is reversible.\n\n**Ambiguity:** 8\n\n**Risk:** 2\n\n**Decision:** ASK\n\n**Question:** \"Which TV would you like me to use to put something informative on?
