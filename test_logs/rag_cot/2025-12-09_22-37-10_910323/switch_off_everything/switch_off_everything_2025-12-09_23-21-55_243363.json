Identify which devices are considered non-essential. This typically includes devices that are not critical for daily living or safety, such as smart lights, smart TVs, and decorative devices.\n2. Use the `refresh` capability on the identified non-essential devices to ensure they are up to date and functioning properly.\n3. If any non-essential devices are found to be malfunctioning, use the `healthCheck` capability to diagnose issues.\nPlanner notes: Non-essential devices in a smart home can include smart lights, smart TVs, and other devices that enhance convenience but are not necessary for basic functionality. The plan involves refreshing these devices to ensure they are operational and checking their health status if any issues arise. Further disambiguation may be required to determine which specific devices the user considers non-essential, as this can vary from person to person. \n\n<FINISHED>",
