Step 2 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is to check the fridge temperature, and there are no specific parameters provided. Step 3 - Apply Logic: Since this is a device control request and checking the current temperature can be done with a safe default (simply checking the temperature), I can proceed without needing clarification. Step 4 - Final Verdict: The command is complete and safe to execute.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe request is a device control action that can be executed safely without additional parameters.",
