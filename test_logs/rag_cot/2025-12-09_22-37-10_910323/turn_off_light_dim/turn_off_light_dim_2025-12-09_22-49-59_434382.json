If you have a specific dimming level in mind, please provide that for more precise control. If you want to dim all lights to the same level, I will apply the same dimming level to each device. \n<FINISHED>",

For each light device (meross-Light-Strip), perform a health check to ensure the device is responsive.\n2. Check the switch level capability to determine if the light is currently dimmed (i.e., at a lower brightness level).\nPlanner notes: Since the command is to identify lights that are currently dim, we will first ensure that each light device is operational by performing a health check. After confirming that the devices are responsive, we will check the switch level to see if they are set to a dimmed state. If the switch level is below a certain threshold (which typically indicates dimming), we can classify that light as dim. Further disambiguation may be needed if specific brightness levels are required to define \"dim.\" \n\n<FINISHED>",
