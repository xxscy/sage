Identify which TV is \"by the plant.\" Since there are two TVs available, we need to clarify which one the user is referring to. \n2. If the user confirms which TV they mean, we can proceed to either turn it on (if it is off) or control its settings (like volume, channel, etc.) using the relevant capabilities.\nPlanner notes: Since the user did not specify which TV is \"by the plant,\" we have two options. Further clarification is needed to determine which TV the user is referring to. Once we have that information, we can execute commands on the selected TV.
