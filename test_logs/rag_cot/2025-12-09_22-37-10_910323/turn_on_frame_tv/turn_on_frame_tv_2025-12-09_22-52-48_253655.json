Identify which specific action the user wants to perform with the Frame TV (e.g., turn it on, change the channel, adjust the volume, etc.).\n2. If the user wants to turn on the TV, use the `switch` capability on either device ID 415228e4-456c-44b1-8602-70f98c67fba8 or 8e20883f-c444-4edf-86bf-64e74c1d70e2.\n3. If the user wants to adjust the volume, use the `audioVolume` capability on the selected TV device.\n4. If the user wants to mute the audio, use the `audioMute` capability on the selected TV device.\n5. If the user wants to change the channel, use the `tvChannel` capability on the selected TV device.\n6. If the user wants to play media, use the `mediaPlayback` capability on the selected TV device.\nPlanner notes: The command \"Frame TV\" is ambiguous as it does not specify what action to perform. Therefore, I have listed both available Frame TV devices and their capabilities. Further clarification from the user is needed to determine the specific action they wish to take with the Frame TV. Once the action is clarified, the appropriate capabilities can be executed on the selected device. \n<FINISHED>",
