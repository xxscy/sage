Identify the current state of the refrigerator using the `contactSensor` capability to check if the door is open or closed.\n2. Measure the current temperature using the `temperatureMeasurement` capability.\n3. If necessary, adjust the cooling setpoint using the `thermostatCoolingSetpoint` capability.\n4. If the refrigerator is in a specific mode (like energy-saving), you can switch modes using the `custom.fridgeMode` capability.\n5. Optionally, check the water filter status using the `custom.waterFilter` capability.\n6. Refresh the state of the refrigerator using the `refresh` capability.\nPlanner notes: The command \"fridge\" is quite broad and could refer to various functions related to the refrigerator. The plan includes checking the door state, measuring temperature, and adjusting settings as needed. Further clarification on what specific action is desired (e.g., checking temperature, changing modes, etc.) would help refine the plan. If the user has a specific task in mind, they should specify it for more targeted assistance. \n\n<FINISHED>",

First, we will check the current temperature, and if it is not within the desired range, we will adjust the cooling setpoint accordingly. The refrigeration capability will ensure that the cooling system is active to maintain the set temperature. \n\n<FINISHED>",
