Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 1, since the `Refined Command` contains a specific, verified source (Channel 7 TSN 2), I can proceed without needing clarification. Step 4 - Final Verdict: The command is complete, verified, and safe.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is based on a verified source for the content the user wants to consume.",
