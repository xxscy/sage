Identify which TV is \"by the plant.\" Since there are two TVs available, we need to determine which one is the correct one. \n2. If the user can specify which TV they are referring to, we can proceed with the next steps. If not, we will need to check both TVs.\n3. Once the correct TV is identified, we can use the `switch` capability to turn it on if it is off.\n4. Depending on the user's intent (e.g., changing the channel, adjusting the volume, etc.), we can use the relevant capabilities such as `audioVolume`, `audioMute`, or `tvChannel`.\nPlanner notes: The command is ambiguous as it does not specify which TV is \"by the plant.\" There are two TVs available, and further clarification is needed to proceed with the command.
