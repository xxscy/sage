However, there are no specific preferences for colors or styles for the living room.\n\nTo make the living room look \"redonkulous,\" I suggest using vibrant colors and playful decorations. You could consider bright lighting, fun throw pillows, or quirky art pieces. If you have any specific ideas in mind or colors you want to incorporate, let me know!",
  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Classify Intent: The request is classified as Device Control. Step 2 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` suggests setting the living room lights to a vibrant color, with a default of bright white if no specific color is provided. However, there is no verified match found for the term \"redonkulous,\" which is subjective and lacks a clear definition. Step 3 - Apply Logic: Since the command is Device Control and a specific parameter (color) is missing, I need to determine if a standard, harmless default can apply. The default of bright white is safe, but the term \"redonkulous\" does not provide a clear actionable directive. Step 4 - Final Verdict: Given the ambiguity of the term \"redonkulous\" and the lack of a verified source, clarification is needed.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command contains an ambiguous term that lacks a clear definition, necessitating user clarification for safe execution.",
