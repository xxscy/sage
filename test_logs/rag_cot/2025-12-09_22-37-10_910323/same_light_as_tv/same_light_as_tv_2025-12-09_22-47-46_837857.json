However, the `Content Verification` indicates that no verifiable match was found. Step 3 - Apply Logic: Since this is Device Control and the command is straightforward, I can apply a safe default (dim, warm light) without needing further clarification. Step 4 - Final Verdict: The command is complete and safe to execute based on the user's history.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear and a safe default can be applied without needing further clarification.",
