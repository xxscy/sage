  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Classify Intent: The user command is classified as Device Control since it involves turning on lights. Step 2 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates turning on the lights in the room where the TV is located, and there are no specific instructions or preferences provided. Step 3 - Apply Logic: Since the command is about turning on lights and a standard default can be applied (turning on all lights in the specified room), it meets the criteria for Logic 2. Step 4 - Final Verdict: The command can proceed without needing clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear, and a safe default can be applied to turn on the lights in the specified room.",
