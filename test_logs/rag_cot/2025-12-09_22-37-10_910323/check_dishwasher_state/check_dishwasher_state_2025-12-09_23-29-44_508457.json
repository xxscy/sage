Step 2 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is marked as UNKNOWN_PARAMETER, indicating that there is no specific information about the dishwashing device or its current state. Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since the request is Device Control and a specific parameter (the current phase) is missing, I cannot apply a harmless default. Step 4 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required to identify the specific dishwashing device and its current state.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe request lacks specific information about the dishwashing device, making it impossible to proceed without clarification.",
