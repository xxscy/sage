If the user can specify which TV they mean (either the Samsung The Frame or the Samsung 8 Series), we can proceed with the relevant commands for that specific TV.\n3. If the user cannot specify, we can execute commands on both TVs to ensure the desired action is taken.\nPlanner notes: The user mentioned \"TV by the plant,\" but did not specify which TV they are referring to. There are two TVs available, and further clarification is needed to determine which one to control. If the user can provide more details, we can execute commands accordingly.
