Use the healthCheck capability on each device to determine their current operational status.\n2. Identify which devices are currently active and their respective states.\n3. Based on the operational status, categorize devices into essential and non-essential based on their functions and current usage.\nPlanner notes: The healthCheck capability will allow us to assess the current state of each device. Once we have the status, we can determine which devices are essential for daily operations and which ones can be considered non-essential. Further actions may be required based on the results of the health checks. If any devices are found to be non-essential, we can consider turning them off or putting them into a low-power state to conserve energy. Further disambiguation may be needed if multiple devices report similar statuses. \n\n<FINISHED>",
