Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since the command is a device control request and there are no specific parameters given, I can apply a standard, harmless default (dim all lights). Step 4 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed without needing further clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is a device control request that can be safely executed with a default action of dimming all lights.",

Check the health status of all lighting devices (meross-Light-Strip) using the `healthCheck` capability.\n   - Device ID: 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298\n   - Device ID: 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709\n   - Device ID: 571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d\n   - Device ID: c4b4a179-6f75-48ed-a6b3-95080be6afc6\n2. If any device is not functioning properly, attempt to refresh the device using the `refresh` capability.\n3. If the user wants to control the lighting (turn on/off, adjust brightness, change color), use the `switch`, `switchLevel`, or `colorControl` capabilities as needed.\nPlanner notes: Since the user mentioned \"lighting devices in the house,\" I have identified all available meross-Light-Strip devices that can be used for lighting control. The plan includes checking their health status first to ensure they are operational before proceeding with any control actions. If further specific actions are required (like turning on/off or changing colors), additional instructions can be provided based on user preferences. Further disambiguation may be needed if the user has specific lighting actions in mind. \n\n<FINISHED>",

  "intent_analysis": "- **Request Type**: Device Control\n- **Identified Situation**: User requests to darken the entire house, indicating a preference for a darker ambiance, possibly for focus or relaxation.\n- **Content Verification**: No verifiable match found\n- **Refined Command**: Dim all lights in the house to a lower brightness level.\n- **Confidence**: High\n- **Reasoning**: The user requested to darken the entire house, which falls under device control. Since there are no specific preferences or past interactions related to this command, I inferred a preference for a darker ambiance based on the previous command to dim the lights in the living room. Therefore, I applied a conservative default to dim all lights in the house. No content verification was necessary as this is a device control command.",
