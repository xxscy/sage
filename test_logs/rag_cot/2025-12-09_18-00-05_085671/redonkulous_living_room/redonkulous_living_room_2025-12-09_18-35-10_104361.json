  "user_preferences": "Based on your preferences, it seems you enjoy a bright and cheerful atmosphere, especially when it's sunny outside, as indicated by your repeated instructions to turn the bedroom lights to yellow. This suggests you prefer warm, inviting lighting that can enhance a positive mood.\n\nIf you're looking to create an impressive atmosphere, you might consider using warm white or soft yellow lighting, perhaps combined with some dimmable options to adjust the brightness based on the time of day or occasion. Additionally, incorporating some ambient lighting, like fairy lights or lamps with soft shades, could further enhance the atmosphere.\n\nIf you have any specific occasions or themes in mind, feel free to share, and I can provide more tailored suggestions!",
  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Classify Intent: The user command is classified as Device Control since it involves adjusting the lighting in the living room. Step 2 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` suggests setting the living room lights to warm white, which is a specific action. However, there was no verifiable match found in the content verification, indicating uncertainty about the user's exact preference. Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since the request is Device Control and a specific parameter (the exact lighting setting) is not provided, I need to determine if a standard, harmless default can apply. In this case, while warm white is a reasonable assumption, it does not align with a clear default action based on the user's vague request for \"redonkulous.\" Step 4 - Final Verdict: Given the lack of a verified source and the ambiguity in the user's request, clarification is needed.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe request lacks a specific, verified source and the user's intent is not clear enough to proceed without confirmation.",
