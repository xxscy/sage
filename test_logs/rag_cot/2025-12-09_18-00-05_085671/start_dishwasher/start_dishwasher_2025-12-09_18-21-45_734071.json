If needed, execute any specific commands using the `execute` capability to control the dishwasher's operation (e.g., start a cycle, check status).\n4. Optionally, refresh the device state using the `refresh` capability to ensure the latest information is retrieved.\nPlanner notes: The command \"dishwasher\" is quite broad, so I will first check the current state of the dishwasher to determine if any action is needed. If the dishwasher is off, I will turn it on. If there are specific tasks or commands you want to execute (like starting a wash cycle), please provide more details. Otherwise, I will proceed with the general steps outlined above. \n<FINISHED>",

If that fails, we can check the operational state to ensure it is ready to start. \n\n<FINISHED>",
