Step 2 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is to get the current temperature of the fridge, and there are no specific parameters provided. Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since the command is a safe default action (retrieving the current temperature), I can proceed without needing clarification. Step 4 - Final Verdict: The command is complete, verified, and safe to execute.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe request is for a safe default action to retrieve the current temperature of the fridge, which does not require user clarification.",
