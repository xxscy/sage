If the user can specify which TV they are referring to, we can proceed with that specific device. If not, we will need to check both TVs.\n3. If the user wants to turn on the TV, we will use the `switch` capability to turn it on.\n4. If the user wants to adjust the volume, we will use the `audioVolume` capability.\n5. If the user wants to mute the TV, we will use the `audioMute` capability.\n6. If the user wants to change the channel or input source, we will use the `tvChannel` or `mediaInputSource` capabilities respectively.\nPlanner notes: Since the user did not specify which TV is \"by the plant,\" we have two options.
