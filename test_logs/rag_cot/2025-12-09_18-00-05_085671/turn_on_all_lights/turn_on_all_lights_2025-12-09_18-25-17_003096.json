  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Classify Intent: The user command is classified as Device Control since it involves turning on lights. Step 2 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is \"Turn on all the lights,\" and there are no specific preferences or past interactions related to this command. Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since the command is straightforward and a safe default (turning on all lights) can be applied, I can proceed without needing clarification. Step 4 - Final Verdict: The command is complete, verified, and safe to execute.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is straightforward, and a safe default can be applied without needing further clarification.",
