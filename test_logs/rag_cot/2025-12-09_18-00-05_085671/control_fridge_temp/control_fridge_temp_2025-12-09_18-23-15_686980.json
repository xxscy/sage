Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since the command is straightforward and a specific temperature is provided, there is no missing parameter that would require clarification. Step 4 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed as requested without needing further input from the user.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is complete, verified, and safe to execute as it specifies a clear action with no ambiguity.",

Identify the current state of the refrigerator using the `contactSensor` capability to check if the door is open or closed.\n2. Use the `temperatureMeasurement` capability to check the current temperature inside the refrigerator.\n3. If necessary, adjust the cooling settings using the `thermostatCoolingSetpoint` capability.\n4. If the refrigerator is in a specific mode (like energy-saving), you can switch modes using the `custom.fridgeMode` capability.\n5. Optionally, refresh the state of the refrigerator using the `refresh` capability to ensure all information is up to date.\nPlanner notes: The command \"fridge\" is quite broad, so I have included steps to check the state and temperature of the refrigerator, as well as options to adjust its settings. If you have a more specific command regarding the refrigerator, please provide that for a more tailored plan. \n<FINISHED>",
