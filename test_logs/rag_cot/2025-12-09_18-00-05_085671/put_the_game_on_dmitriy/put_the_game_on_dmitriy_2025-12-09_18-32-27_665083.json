Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 1, since the `Refined Command` contains \"UNKNOWN\" and relies on unverified assumptions, I need to ask for clarification. Step 4 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required to determine which game the user wants to watch.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command lacks a specific game or channel, making it impossible to proceed without clarification.",
