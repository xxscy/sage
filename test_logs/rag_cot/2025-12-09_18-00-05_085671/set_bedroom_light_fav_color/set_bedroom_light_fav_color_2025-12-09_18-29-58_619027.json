Step 2 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates an attempt to set the bedroom light to a specific color, but it is marked as UNKNOWN_PARAMETER due to the lack of information about the user's favorite color. Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since a specific parameter (the favorite color) is missing and cannot be defaulted to a harmless option, I need to ask for clarification. Step 4 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required to determine the user's favorite color for the light.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command cannot be executed safely or accurately without knowing the user's favorite color.",
