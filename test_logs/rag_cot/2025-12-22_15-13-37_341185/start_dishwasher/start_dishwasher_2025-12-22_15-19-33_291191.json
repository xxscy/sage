    "[5.00] [dishwasher] Samsung | Caps: switch, execute, ocf (+24 more) | State: main(switch=off)\nPlanner plan: 1. Check the current operating state of the dishwasher using the capability `dishwasherOperatingState`.\n2. If the dishwasher is off, use the `switch` capability to turn it on.\n3. If needed, use the `execute` capability to send any specific commands to the dishwasher (e.g., start a cycle).\n4. Optionally, check the `dishwasherOperatingProgress` to monitor the current progress of the dishwasher.\nPlanner notes: The command \"dishwasher\" is quite broad, so I will first check the operating state of the dishwasher to determine if it needs to be turned on or if any specific actions are required. If further actions are needed, I can execute them based on the current state. If you have a specific action in mind (like starting a wash cycle or checking the status), please provide more details. \n<FINISHED>",

If this command fails, I would then check the \"dishwasherOperatingState\" capability to see if it can be used to change the state of the dishwasher to \"on\" or \"running.\" However, starting with the \"execute\" command is the best approach. \n\n<FINISHED>",
