Step 2 - Classify Intent: The intent is classified as Device Control since the user wants to turn on a TV. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates a desire to turn on a TV, but it does not specify which TV by the plant, leading to ambiguity. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Logic 2 applies here, specifically the singular target requirement, as there are multiple TVs and the command does not specify which one to turn on. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required to identify which TV to control.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is ambiguous regarding which TV to turn on, necessitating user clarification.",

Identify which TV is \"by the plant.\" Since there are two TVs available, we need to determine which one is the correct device. \n2. If the user can specify which TV they are referring to, we can proceed with that specific device. If not, we will need to check both TVs.\n3. If the user wants to turn on the TV, we will use the `switch` capability to power it on.\n4. If the user wants to adjust the volume, we can use the `audioVolume` capability.\n5. If the user wants to mute the TV, we can use the `audioMute` capability.\n6. If the user wants to change the channel or input source, we can use the `tvChannel` or `mediaInputSource` capabilities respectively.\nPlanner notes: Since the user did not specify which TV is \"by the plant,\" we have two options. Further clarification is needed to determine which TV to interact with. Once we have that information, we can execute the desired actions using the relevant capabilities. \n\n<FINISHED>",
