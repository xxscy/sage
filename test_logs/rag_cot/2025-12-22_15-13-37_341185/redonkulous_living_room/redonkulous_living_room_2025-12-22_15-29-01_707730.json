Step 2 - Classify Intent: The intent is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates turning on all meross Light Strips in the living room and setting their brightness to 70%. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since there are multiple meross Light Strips and the command is vague regarding the specific style or color, I will proceed with the action of turning on all the light strips and setting their brightness to a conservative default of 70%. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed based on the available information and inferred defaults.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command can be reasonably completed by turning on all light strips and setting their brightness to 70%, as no specific style or color was provided.",

Use the `switchLevel` capability to dim or brighten the lights as needed.\nPlanner notes: The meross Light Strips are ideal for enhancing living room decor due to their ability to change colors and adjust brightness. Since there are multiple light strips available, you may choose to use one or more of them based on your preference.

Further disambiguation may be required if you have specific preferences for which light strip to use. \n\n<FINISHED>",

Since there are multiple devices, I will check the health of each one to ensure they are operational before proceeding to control their lighting options. If any device is not functioning, I will attempt to refresh it. After confirming their functionality, I will provide options to control the lights, including turning them on/off, adjusting brightness, and changing colors.

Use the `colorControl` capability to set the desired lighting effects (hue, saturation, and color values) on each of the meross Light Strips.\n3. Optionally, adjust the `colorTemperature` to create a warmer or cooler lighting effect as desired.\n4. If needed, use the `switchLevel` capability to dim or brighten the lights to achieve the desired ambiance.\nPlanner notes: Since the command is somewhat vague regarding the specific effects desired, I have included all available meross Light Strips as they are likely to be the devices used for lighting effects. The capabilities related to color and brightness adjustments are included to cover a range of potential lighting effects.
