First, check if the Samsung The Frame TV is powered on. If not, use the `samsungvd.supportsPowerOnByOcf` capability to turn it on.\n2. Use the `mediaInputSource` capability on the Samsung The Frame TV (ID: 415228e4-456c-44b1-8602-70f98c67fba8) to set the input source to the game console or streaming service where the game is available.\n3. If necessary, use the `mediaPlayback` capability to start the game if it is already set to the correct input source.\nPlanner notes: Since the user did not specify which game or how it is being played (console, streaming service, etc.), I will assume that the game is accessible through a common input source like a console or streaming app. If the game is on a specific channel, the `tvChannel` capability can also be used to switch to that channel. Further disambiguation may be required if the game is not found or if there are multiple input sources. \n\n<FINISHED>",
