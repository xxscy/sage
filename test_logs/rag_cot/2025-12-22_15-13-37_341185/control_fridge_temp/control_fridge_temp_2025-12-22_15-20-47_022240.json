Step 2 - Classify Intent: The intent is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` specifies a clear action to set the cooling setpoint of the refrigerator to a specific temperature. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Logic 2 applies here, and since the command specifies a single target (the Samsung refrigerator) and a specific value (5 degrees Celsius), it can be executed without ambiguity. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command is clear and actionable without needing further clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies a clear action to set the refrigerator's temperature, and there is no ambiguity in the target or the value.",

Use the `temperatureMeasurement` capability on the refrigerator (Device ID: 51f02f33-4b43-11bf-2a6d-e7b5cf5be0ee) to check the current internal temperature.\n2. If the user wants to change the temperature settings, use the `thermostatCoolingSetpoint` capability to set the desired cooling temperature.\nPlanner notes: The refrigerator is the only device available that can manage internal temperature settings. The `temperatureMeasurement` capability will allow us to read the current temperature, and the `thermostatCoolingSetpoint` capability will allow us to adjust the cooling settings if needed. Further clarification from the user may be required to determine if they want to check the current temperature, change it, or both. \n\n<FINISHED>",
