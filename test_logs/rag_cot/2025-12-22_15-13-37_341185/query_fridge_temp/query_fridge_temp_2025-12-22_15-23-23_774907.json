  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: The command \"What is the fridge temperature?\" is an information request seeking to know the current state of the refrigerator's temperature. Step 2 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control since it involves checking the status of a device. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` specifies checking the current temperature of the Samsung refrigerator, which is a clear and direct request. Step 4 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 0, since this is an information request, it does not require modification or additional parameters. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command is straightforward and does not need clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is an information request about the fridge temperature, which can be completed without further interaction.",
