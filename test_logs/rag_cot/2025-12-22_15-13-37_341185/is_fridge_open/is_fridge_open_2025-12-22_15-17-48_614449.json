Step 2 - Classify Intent: The request is classified as Device Control since it involves checking the state of a device. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` specifies checking the state of the fridge door using the contactSensor capability, and there is a high confidence in the command's clarity and actionability. Step 4 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 0, this is an information request, so it does not require further action or clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command is clear and actionable without needing additional input.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is an information request about the fridge door state, which can be completed as-is without further clarification.",
