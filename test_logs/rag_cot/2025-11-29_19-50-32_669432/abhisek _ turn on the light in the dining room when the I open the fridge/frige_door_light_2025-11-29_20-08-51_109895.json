These devices are likely located in the dining room, as inferred from the user command to turn on the light in that area.\n\n2) The current states of the devices indicate that the meross-Light-Strip devices have varying switch levels, with Device ID 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298 set to 70, Device ID 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709 at 48, and Device ID 571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d at 35. All three devices are capable of being turned on, as their switch states are currently set to \"on.\" Additionally, the refrigerator is currently closed, which is relevant for the user command to activate the light when the fridge is opened.",
