  "environment_overview": "1) The detected devices include multiple meross Light Strips, specifically three identified by their unique device IDs: 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298, 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709, and 571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d. All three devices have capabilities for switching, adjusting switch levels, controlling color temperature, and color control. The context indicates that the targeted devices are primarily focused on lighting.\n\n2) The current states of the meross Light Strips show that the first device (ID: 22e11820) is set to a switch level of 70 and is capable of color control with saturation at 100. The second device (ID: 363f714d) has a switch level of 48 but lacks specific color settings. The third device (ID: 571f0327) is at a switch level of 35 with full color control capabilities. All devices are currently off, and the actionable control is to turn them on sequentially until the command is successfully executed.",
