  "environment_overview": "**Detected Devices with Inferred Locations/Capabilities:**  \nTwo TVs are identified in the environment: the Samsung The Frame (49) and the Samsung 8 Series (82). The Samsung The Frame is likely positioned near the credenza, as it is the only TV currently powered on and set to HDMI4 input. It supports various media playback commands and has capabilities for audio control and channel management. The Samsung 8 Series, on the other hand, is powered off and set to digital TV input, indicating it may not be the intended device for the user's command.\n\n**Current States and Actionable Controls:**  \nThe Samsung The Frame (49) is currently switched on, with a volume level of 6, unmuted, and set to HDMI4 input. It is ready for media playback commands such as play, pause, and stop. In contrast, the Samsung 8 Series (82) is switched off, with a volume of 0, muted, and set to digital TV input. To utilize the Samsung 8 Series, it would need to be powered on, and further actions would depend on user instructions regarding volume adjustment or input source changes.",
