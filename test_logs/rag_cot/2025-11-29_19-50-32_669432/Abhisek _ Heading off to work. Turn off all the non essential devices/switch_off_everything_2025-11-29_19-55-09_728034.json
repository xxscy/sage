The c2c-switch is capable of switching and health checks, while the meross Light Strips have capabilities for switching, adjusting switch levels, and color control. The Samsung TVs are also equipped with switching capabilities, indicating they can be turned on or off remotely.\n\n2) The current states of the devices are as follows: the c2c-switch is off, and the three meross Light Strips have switch levels set at 70 and 48, respectively, indicating they are on but can be turned off. The Samsung TVs are operational but require health checks to confirm their status before any action. The actionable control for all devices includes the ability to turn them off using their respective switch capabilities.",
