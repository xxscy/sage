  "environment_overview": "1) The detected devices include three meross Light Strips, each capable of switching on/off, adjusting brightness (switchLevel), and controlling color. The identified devices are: one with a current level of 70, another at 48, and a third at 90. These devices are likely positioned near the fireplace, as inferred from the user command to dim the lights by the fireplace.\n\n2) The current states of the light strips indicate that they are all powered on, with brightness levels of 70, 48, and 90, respectively. To execute the user command to dim the lights to a third of their current value, the actionable control will involve adjusting the brightness levels to approximately 23, 16, and 30. The switch capability confirms that the lights are on, allowing for immediate adjustment using the switchLevel capability. Further disambiguation may be required to determine which specific light strip to adjust based on proximity to the fireplace.",
