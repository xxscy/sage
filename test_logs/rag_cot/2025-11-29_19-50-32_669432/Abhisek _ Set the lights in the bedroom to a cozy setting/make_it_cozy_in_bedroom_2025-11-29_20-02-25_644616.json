The first light strip (22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298) is currently off, while the second (363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709) and third (571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d) are on, with varying brightness levels and color settings.\n\n2) The current states of the light strips are as follows: the first light strip is off, the second is on with a brightness level of 48 and a color temperature of 7000K, and the third is on with a brightness level of 35 and a color temperature of 2300K. Actionable controls include turning the first light strip on, adjusting the brightness of the second and third light strips, and changing their color settings if desired. The first light strip can be activated, and the brightness and color of the other two can be modified to achieve a cozy setting as requested.",
