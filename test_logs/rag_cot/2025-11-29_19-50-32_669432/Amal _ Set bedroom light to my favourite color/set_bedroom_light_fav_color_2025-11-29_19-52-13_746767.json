  "environment_overview": "1) The detected devices include three meross-Light-Strip units, which are likely located in the bedroom based on the user command. Each device has capabilities for switching on/off, adjusting brightness (switchLevel), and controlling color (colorControl). The specific devices identified are: meross-Light-Strip (22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298), meross-Light-Strip (363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709), and meross-Light-Strip (571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d), all of which can be utilized to fulfill the user's request.\n\n2) The current states of the meross-Light-Strip devices indicate that one is off (22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298) with a brightness level of 70, while the other two are on, with brightness levels of 48 and 35, respectively. The off device can be powered on, while the on devices can have their brightness adjusted or colors changed. The actionable controls include switching the off device on, adjusting the brightness of the on devices, and changing their color settings to match the user's favorite color.",
