These devices are capable of switching on/off, adjusting brightness levels, controlling color temperature, and managing color settings. Their inferred locations suggest they are positioned throughout the house, contributing to the overall lighting environment.\n\n2) The current states of the light strips indicate varying brightness levels: the first light strip is set to 70%, the second to 48%, and the third to 35%. Actionable controls include the ability to turn off each light strip using the switch capability and to adjust their brightness to the lowest level if they are not already off. The planner will execute commands to ensure all light strips are turned off or dimmed, effectively darkening the entire house.",
