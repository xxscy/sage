Additionally, there are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices that can be controlled for lighting, as well as a c2c-switch device that can manage power states. The TVs are located in a media area, while the meross-Light-Strips are likely positioned in a living or decorative space, possibly near the fireplace.\n\n2) Currently, both Samsung TVs are powered on, with the Samsung The Frame (49) set to HDMI4 input and the Samsung 8 Series (82) using the digital TV input. The TVs can be turned off using the audioMute capability. The meross-Light-Strip devices are all in the off state, and the c2c-switch is also off. Actionable controls include muting the audio on both TVs to turn them off and switching on any of the available meross-Light-Strip devices to activate the fireplace light.",
