The Samsung 8 Series is also present but is not specified to be near the credenza; it supports media playback and is limited to a digital TV input source.\n\n2) The current state of the Samsung The Frame is powered on, with a volume level of 6, unmuted, and set to HDMI4 as the input source. The Samsung 8 Series is powered off, with a volume level of 0, muted, and set to digital TV as the input source. Actionable controls for the Samsung The Frame include adjusting the volume, switching input sources, and executing playback commands. The Samsung 8 Series can be powered on, but it currently does not have any active controls due to its off state.",
