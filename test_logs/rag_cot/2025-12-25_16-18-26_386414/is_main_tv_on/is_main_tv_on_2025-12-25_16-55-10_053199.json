Additionally, Amal has requested information about TV shows available on streaming services, indicating a preference for accessible content.\n\nThere is no explicit information about specific TV usage preferences, such as frequency of watching or preferred times, but the focus on TV shows over movies suggests a stronger inclination towards episodic content.
