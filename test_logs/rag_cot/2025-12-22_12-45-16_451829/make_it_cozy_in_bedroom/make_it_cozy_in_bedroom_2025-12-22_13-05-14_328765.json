Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command is Device Control and the refinement provides a clear action without ambiguity, I can proceed without needing clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command is complete, verified, and safe to execute.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is a clear request to set the lights to a specific setting, which has been refined appropriately without ambiguity.",

First, ensure that the lights are powered on. Use the `switch` capability on all relevant light strip devices (IDs: 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298, 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709, 571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d, c4b4a179-6f75-48ed-a6b3-95080be6afc6).\n2. Set the color temperature to a warm value to create a cozy atmosphere using the `colorTemperature` capability on the same devices.\n3. Optionally, adjust the brightness level using the `switchLevel` capability to further enhance the cozy setting.\nPlanner notes: The cozy setting typically involves warm lighting, which can be achieved by adjusting the color temperature to a lower value (e.g., around 2700K) and possibly dimming the lights. Since there are multiple light strip devices available, I will attempt to control all of them to ensure the desired effect is achieved. If any device fails to respond, I will try the next one in the sequence. Further disambiguation may be needed if the user specifies which specific light strip to use. \n\n<FINISHED>",
