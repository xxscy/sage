Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command is Device Control and does not have an explicit preference for light settings, I can apply a safe default to represent the Montreal Canadiens.

Identify the specific lights by the TV, dining room, and fireplace. Since the user did not specify which light strips correspond to each location, we will assume that all available light strips can be used.\n2. For each light strip, execute the following commands:\n   - Use the `switch` capability to turn on the lights if they are off.\n   - Use the `colorControl` capability to change the color of the lights as desired (the user did not specify the color, so we will need to ask for that).\n   - Optionally, use the `switchLevel` capability to adjust the brightness if needed (again, the user did not specify the brightness level).\nPlanner notes: Since the user did not provide specific details about which light strips correspond to each location, we are listing all available light strips. Further disambiguation is required to determine the exact colors and brightness levels desired for each location. Please provide the specific colors and brightness levels for the lights by the TV, dining room, and fireplace. \n<FINISHED>",
