Identify which meross-Light-Strip device is in the bedroom. If there are multiple, further disambiguation is needed.\n2. If the device is off, use the `switch` capability to turn it on.\n3. Optionally, adjust the brightness using the `switchLevel` capability if needed.\n4. Optionally, adjust the color or temperature using the `colorControl` or `colorTemperature` capabilities if desired.\nPlanner notes: Since there are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices, it's important to identify which one is specifically in the bedroom. If the user can clarify which device they are referring to, I can provide a more precise plan. If not, I will proceed with the assumption that any of the listed devices could be the one in question. The capabilities listed will allow for basic control of the light, including turning it on/off and adjusting its brightness and color settings. \n<FINISHED>",
