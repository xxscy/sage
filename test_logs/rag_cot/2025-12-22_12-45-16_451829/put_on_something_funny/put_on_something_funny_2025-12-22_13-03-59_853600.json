  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: The command is not an information request; it seeks to play content. Step 2 - Classify Intent: The intent is classified as Content Consumption. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is marked as UNKNOWN_CHANNEL, indicating that no specific, verified source was found. Step 4 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 1, since the `Refined Command` contains \"UNKNOWN\" and relies on unverified assumptions, clarification is needed. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Clarification is strictly required due to the lack of a verified content source.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command lacks a specific and verified content source, necessitating user clarification.",
