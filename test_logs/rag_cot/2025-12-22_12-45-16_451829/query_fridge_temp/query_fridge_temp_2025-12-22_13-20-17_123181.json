Step 2 - Classify Intent: The request is classified as Device Control since it involves querying the state of a device. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is marked as UNKNOWN_PARAMETER, indicating that there is no specific command or default value available for the fridge temperature. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command is classified as Device Control and the `Refined Command` is ambiguous with no reasonable default inferred, I must ask for clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required due to the ambiguity in the command.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is ambiguous and lacks a verifiable parameter for the fridge temperature, necessitating user clarification.",
