First, check the current operating state of the dishwasher using the `dishwasherOperatingState` capability.\n2. If the dishwasher is off, use the `switch` capability to turn it on.\n3. If needed, use the `execute` capability to send any specific commands to the dishwasher, such as starting a wash cycle or checking the job state.\n4. Optionally, if the user wants to know the progress or percentage of the current operation, use `custom.dishwasherOperatingProgress` or `custom.dishwasherOperatingPercentage`.\nPlanner notes: The command is quite broad as it only mentions \"dishwasher.\" Therefore, I will first check the operating state to determine if any action is needed. If the dishwasher is off, I will turn it on. The capabilities available for the dishwasher allow for various operations, including checking its state, controlling it, and monitoring its progress. Further disambiguation may be required if the user has a specific action in mind (e.g., starting a wash, checking status, etc.). \n\n<FINISHED>",
