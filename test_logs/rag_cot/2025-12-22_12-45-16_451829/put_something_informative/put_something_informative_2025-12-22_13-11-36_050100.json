If the user can specify which TV they mean, we can proceed with the relevant commands. If not, we can prepare to send commands to both TVs.\n3. If the user wants to turn on the TV, we will use the `switch` capability to power it on.\n4. If the user wants to adjust the volume or mute the TV, we will use the `audioVolume` or `audioMute` capabilities respectively.\n5. If the user wants to change the channel or input source, we will use the `tvChannel` or `mediaInputSource` capabilities.\nPlanner notes: Since the user did not specify which TV is \"by the plant,\" we have two options.
