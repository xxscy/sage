Identify which TV to use. Since the user mentioned \"the TV by the plant,\" further clarification is needed to determine which of the two TVs is the correct one.\n2. If the user confirms which TV to use, proceed to check if the TV is powered on. If not, turn it on using the `switch` capability.\n3. Use the `mediaInputSource` capability to set the appropriate input source for playing content (e.g., streaming service, HDMI).\n4. Use the `mediaPlayback` capability to play the desired content for the kids. If specific content is not mentioned, consider using the `custom.tvsearch` capability to find suitable children's content.\n5. If the user wants to launch a specific app, use the `custom.launchapp` capability to open that app.\nPlanner notes: Since there are two TVs available, I need clarification on which one to use. The capabilities listed will allow for controlling the playback of media on the selected TV. If the user does not specify content, I can search for children's content using the TV's search capability.
