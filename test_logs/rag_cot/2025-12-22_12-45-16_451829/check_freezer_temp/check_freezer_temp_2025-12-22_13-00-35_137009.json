  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: The command is asking for the current temperature of the freezer, which is an information request. Step 2 - Classify Intent: The request is classified as Device Control since it involves querying the state of a device. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is marked as UNKNOWN_PARAMETER, indicating that there is no specific or verified information available. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command is classified as Device Control and the `Refined Command` is ambiguous with no reasonable default, I must ask for clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required due to the lack of verifiable content regarding the freezer's temperature.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is an information request about the freezer's temperature, but it lacks verified content, necessitating clarification.",
