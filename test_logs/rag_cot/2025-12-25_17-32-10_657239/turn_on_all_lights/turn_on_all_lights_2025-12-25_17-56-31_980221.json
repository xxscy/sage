However, the specific devices are ambiguous as there are multiple light strips available, leading to the classification as [AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE].\n\n3. **Preference Handling:**\n   - The user's preference for dim, warm temperature light is noted, but there is no explicit request for this preference in the command. Therefore, it cannot be applied, resulting in [UNKNOWN_PARAMETER].\n\n4. **Subjective Terms:**\n   - The term \"lights\" is subjective and does not specify which lights to turn on, contributing to the ambiguity.\n\n5. **Risk Level:**\n   - The action of turning on lights is classified as low risk since it is reversible and does not involve security systems or irreversible actions.\n\n6. **Confidence Level:**\n   - The confidence is low due to the ambiguity in identifying which specific lights to control, despite having a clear command type and context.",
