  "intent_analysis": "**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Intent Classification**: The command \"Amal: Set bedroom light to my favourite color\" indicates a **Device Control** intent, specifically for controlling lighting.\n\n2. **Device Resolution**:\n   - **Location Cues**: The command specifies \"bedroom light,\" but there is no explicit device context provided for the bedroom. However, we have three devices listed, all of which are \"meross-Light-Strip\" and can control color.\n   - **Type Cues**: All devices are of the same type (light strips) and have color control capabilities.\n   - **State Cues**: Two of the devices are currently \"on\" (with levels 48 and 35), while one is \"off.\" Since the command is to set a color, it would be reasonable to choose one of the \"on\" devices.\n   - **Multiple Devices**: The most recently used or most accessible device is preferred. Since there is no history available, we can choose the device with the higher brightness level (48) for better visibility.\n\n3. **Parameter Resolution**: The command lacks specific information about \"Amal's favorite color.\" Since there is no data available regarding this preference, we cannot resolve this parameter. A safe default color (e.g., white) can be inferred for the action to proceed.\n\n4. **Content Resolution**: The command does not involve content selection, but rather a direct action on the device.\n\n**Resolution Rules**:\n- Since we have multiple devices, we will select the one that is \"on\" with the highest brightness level (48).\n- The color parameter is unclear, so we will use a safe default color (white).\n\n**Output**:\n- **Refined Command**: \"Set meross-Light-Strip (device_id: 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f98ef66de298) to white.\"\n- **Risk Assessment**: Low (the action is reversible and involves adjusting a light).\n- **Confidence**: Low (due to the ambiguity of the color parameter).",
