The current levels are 70, 48, and 35. The best choice for dim, warm light would be to adjust the light to a lower level, ideally around 35 or 48, as these are closer to his preference.\n\n4. **Content Resolution**: \n   - Since the command is to turn on the light and all lights are already on, the action will involve adjusting the brightness to a level that aligns with Abhisek's preferences.\n\n**Resolution**:\n- The most reasonable action is to adjust the light that is currently at level 35 to a warmer, dimmer setting, as it aligns with Abhisek's preferences.\n\n**Refined Command**: \"Abhisek : Set the meross-Light-Strip to dim, warm light at level 35.\"\n\n**Risk Assessment**: Low - Adjusting light levels is a reversible action.\n\n**Confidence**: High - The command is clear, and the preferences are well understood.",
