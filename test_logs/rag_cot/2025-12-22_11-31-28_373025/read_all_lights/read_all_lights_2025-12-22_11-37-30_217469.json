Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since the command is about checking the status of all lights and no specific parameters are missing, a standard harmless default can apply (checking all lights). Step 4 - Final Verdict: The command can proceed without needing clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is complete and can be executed safely by checking the status of all lights without needing further clarification.",
