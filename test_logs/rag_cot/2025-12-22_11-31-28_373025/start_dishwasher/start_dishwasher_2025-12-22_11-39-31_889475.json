Optionally, check the `dishwasherOperatingProgress` or `dishwasherOperatingPercentage` to monitor the current status of the wash cycle.\nPlanner notes: The command \"dishwasher\" is quite broad, so I will first check the operational state of the dishwasher to determine if it needs to be turned on or if any specific actions are required.

If you have a specific action in mind (like starting a wash cycle or checking the status), please provide more details. \n<FINISHED>",
