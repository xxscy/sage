If any of the light strips are operational, use the switch capability to turn on the light.\nPlanner notes: Since the user referred to a light by the nightstand, and there are multiple light strips available, I will check the health of all the light strips first to ensure they are operational. After confirming their status, I will proceed to turn on the light using the switch capability. Further disambiguation may be needed if the user has a specific light strip in mind. \n<FINISHED>",

Use the `remoteControlStatus` capability on the dishwasher (Device ID: 6c645f61-0b82-235f-e476-8a6afc0e73dc) to check if it is currently operational.\n2. If the dishwasher is operational, use the `dishwasherOperatingState` capability to get the current state of the dishwasher.\n3. Additionally, use `custom.dishwasherOperatingProgress` and `custom.dishwasherOperatingPercentage` to get detailed information about the progress and percentage of the current cycle.\nPlanner notes: The `remoteControlStatus` capability will help determine if the dishwasher is on and responsive. If it is, the other capabilities will provide insights into its current operating state and progress. If the dishwasher is not responsive, further troubleshooting may be required. \n<FINISHED>",

  "intent_analysis": "- **Request Type**: Device Control\n- **Identified Situation**: User wants to turn on the light by the nightstand when the dishwasher has completed its cycle.\n- **Content Verification**: No verifiable match found\n- **Refined Command**: Turn on the light by the nightstand when the dishwasher is done.\n- **Confidence**: High\n- **Reasoning**: The command is a straightforward device control request to turn on a specific light based on the completion of another device's task (the dishwasher). Since there are no specific parameters or preferences provided for the light's state or intensity, the command is issued with safe defaults, assuming the user wants the light to be turned on without any additional specifications. No content consumption request was made, and thus the TV Guide was not applicable in this context.",
