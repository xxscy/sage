Then, we will adjust the color temperature to a warm setting, dim the lights to a comfortable brightness, and finally set a cozy color. Since there are multiple light strip devices, we will apply the same commands to all of them to ensure a uniform cozy atmosphere. If any command fails on one device, we can try the others. \n\n<FINISHED>",
