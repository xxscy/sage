Identify which TV is \"by the plant.\" Since there are two TVs available, we need to determine which one is the correct one. \n2. If the user can specify which TV they are referring to, we can proceed with that specific device. If not, we will need to check both TVs.\n3. If the user wants to turn on the TV, we will use the `switch` capability to power it on.\n4. If the user wants to adjust the volume, we can use the `audioVolume` capability.\n5. If the user wants to mute the TV, we can use the `audioMute` capability.\n6. If the user wants to change the channel or input source, we can use the `tvChannel` or `mediaInputSource` capabilities respectively.\nPlanner notes: Since the user did not specify which TV is \"by the plant,\" we have two options. Further clarification is needed to determine which TV to control. Once we have that information, we can execute the desired actions using the relevant capabilities. \n\n<FINISHED>",
