Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since the command is complete and specifies a safe, actionable parameter (5 degrees Celsius), there is no need for clarification. Step 4 - Final Verdict: The command is clear and actionable without any ambiguity.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is complete, verified, and safe as it specifies a clear and actionable temperature setting for the fridge.",

Check the current state of the refrigerator to ensure it is operational using the `refresh` capability.\n2. Set the internal temperature of the refrigerator to 5 degrees Celsius using the `thermostatCoolingSetpoint` capability.\nPlanner notes: The only device available for controlling the fridge is the Samsung refrigerator. The `thermostatCoolingSetpoint` capability will allow us to set the desired temperature. Before setting the temperature, it's prudent to check if the refrigerator is operational to avoid any errors during the process. \n\n<FINISHED>",
