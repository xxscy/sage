  "reasoning": "**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Information Requests:** The command does not involve an information request, so this rule does not apply.\n2. **High Risk:** The command involves adjusting lighting, which is generally considered low risk. Therefore, this rule does not apply.\n3. **Medium/High Risk AND Markers Present:** The risk is assessed as low, and while there is an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER, it does not elevate the risk to medium/high. Thus, this rule does not apply.\n4. **Low Risk AND Markers Present BUT Context Resolves:** The command is low risk, and while there is an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER, the context of adjusting lights is straightforward and does not require further clarification. Therefore, this rule does not apply.\n5. **Low Risk AND Markers Present AND Context Cannot Resolve:** The command is low risk, and while there is an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER, the context is clear enough to proceed without additional interaction. Thus, this rule does not apply.\n6. **Collective References:** There are no collective references in the command, so this rule does not apply.\n7. **Content Unverified:** The command is straightforward and does not involve unverified content, so this rule does not apply.\n8. **Subjective Terms:** The term \"cozy setting\" is subjective and not easily mappable from preferences, which introduces some ambiguity.\n\n**Conclusion:** Need\n\n**Reason:** Although the overall risk is low and the command is clear, the presence of the UNKNOWN_PARAMETER related to the subjective term \"cozy setting\" introduces ambiguity that cannot be resolved without further interaction. Therefore, it is prudent to engage the human interaction tool to clarify the user's specific preference for the lighting setting.",
