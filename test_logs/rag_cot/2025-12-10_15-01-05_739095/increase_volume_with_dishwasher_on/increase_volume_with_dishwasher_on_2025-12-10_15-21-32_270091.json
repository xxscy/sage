Since there are two TVs available, I will need to check both:\n   - For the first TV (Samsung The Frame), I will use the `switch` capability to turn it on if it is off.\n   - For the second TV (Samsung 8 Series), I will also use the `switch` capability to turn it on if it is off.\n   \n2.

If the user wants to perform specific actions on the TV or dishwasher, I will need further clarification on what they would like to do with each device.\nPlanner notes: Since the user mentioned both the TV and dishwasher without specifying actions, I have outlined a plan to turn on both devices. However, further clarification is needed to understand what specific actions the user wants to perform with the TV and dishwasher. The TVs can be controlled independently, and the dishwasher can also be operated separately. If the user has a specific command in mind (like playing a show on the TV or starting a wash cycle on the dishwasher), that information would help refine the plan. \n\n<FINISHED>",
