Identify which light device to control. Since there are multiple light strips, I will use the first one (22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298) to turn on the light.\n   - Use capability: switch\n   - Command: Turn on the light.\n   \n2. Next, I will check the refrigerator's state to ensure it is functioning properly.\n   - Use capability: refrigeration\n   - Command: Check the refrigeration state.\nPlanner notes: Since the user mentioned \"light in the dining room,\" I assumed they want to turn on the light. There are multiple light strip devices available, so I will use the first one for simplicity. For the fridge, I will check its refrigeration state to ensure it is operating correctly. If further actions are needed for the fridge or if the user wants to control a specific light strip, additional clarification may be required. \n\n<FINISHED>",
