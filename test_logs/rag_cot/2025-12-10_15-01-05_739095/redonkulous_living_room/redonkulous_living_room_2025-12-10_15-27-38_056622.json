  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Classify Intent: The command is classified as Device Control since it involves adjusting the lighting in the living room. Step 2 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` suggests setting the living room lighting to vibrant colors, but it lacks specific parameters such as the exact color or intensity. The confidence level is low due to the unverified content and ambiguous target. Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since there are missing parameters and no standard harmless default can be applied (as \"redonkulous\" is subjective and not a recognized setting), I need to ask for clarification. Step 4 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required to ensure the user’s intent is accurately captured.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command lacks specific parameters for the lighting, and there is no standard default that can be safely applied.",
