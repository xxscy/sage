If the user wants to turn on the TV, we will use the `switch` capability to power it on.\n4. If the user wants to adjust the volume, we will use the `audioVolume` capability.\n5. If the user wants to mute the TV, we will use the `audioMute` capability.\n6. If the user wants to change the channel, we will use the `tvChannel` capability.\n7. If the user wants to play media, we will use the `mediaPlayback` capability.\nPlanner notes: Since the user did not specify which TV is \"by the plant,\" we have two options.
