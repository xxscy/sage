However, from the available preferences, we know that Abhisek specifically likes \"dim, warm temperature light\" and finds it snug. \n\nTherefore, the preference-related query for retrieval should focus on adjusting the lighting to \"dim, warm temperature light\" rather than turning on all the lights.",
  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Classify Intent: The request is classified as Device Control since it involves turning on lights. Step 2 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is \"Turn on the lights to dim, warm temperature light,\" which reflects the user's preference. The content verification status indicates no specific source was found, but the command is clear and verified based on the user's stated preference. Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since the command is a device control request and a standard harmless default (turning on lights to a dim, warm temperature) can be applied, I can proceed without needing clarification. Step 4 - Final Verdict: The command is complete, verified, and safe to execute based on the user's preference.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear and reflects the user's preference for lighting, allowing for safe execution without ambiguity.",
