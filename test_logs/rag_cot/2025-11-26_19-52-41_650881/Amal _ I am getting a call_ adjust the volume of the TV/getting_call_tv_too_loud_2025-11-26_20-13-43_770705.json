The key action is \"adjust the volume,\" and the context is a phone call.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: Amal likely wants to lower the TV volume to ensure they can hear the phone call clearly without interference from the TV sound. The command implies a need for a change in the current state of the TV volume, which is currently set at 75% and muted.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: There is no specific preference for how much to adjust the volume during phone calls. The command does not specify whether to increase or decrease the volume, leading to ambiguity. However, given the context of a phone call, it is reasonable to infer that the user wants to lower the volume.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity regarding whether to increase or decrease the volume can be resolved by applying common sense reasoning. Since the user is receiving a call, it is logical to assume they want the volume decreased to avoid distraction.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe intent to lower the TV volume during a phone call is clear, and the ambiguity regarding the specific adjustment can be reasonably resolved by inferring that the user wants to decrease the volume.\n```",
