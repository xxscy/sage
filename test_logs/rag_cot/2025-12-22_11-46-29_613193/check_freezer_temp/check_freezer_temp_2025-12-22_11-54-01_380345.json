Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since the request is Device Control and the parameter (current temperature) is missing, I cannot apply a harmless default because the specific temperature is unknown. Step 4 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required to provide an accurate response.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe request for the current temperature of the freezer lacks a verifiable parameter, necessitating user clarification.",
