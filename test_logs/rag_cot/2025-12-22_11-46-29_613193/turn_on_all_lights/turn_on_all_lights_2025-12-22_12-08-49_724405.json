Therefore, when he requests to \"turn on all the lights,\" it would be reasonable to infer that he might prefer the lights to be set to a dim and warm setting rather than bright or harsh lighting.\n\nThe preference-related query for retrieval could be: \"Turn on the lights to a dim, warm temperature setting.\"",
  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Classify Intent: The user command is classified as Device Control since it involves turning on lights. Step 2 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` suggests turning on the lights to a dim, warm temperature setting, but there are no specific parameters provided for the lights. Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since a standard harmless default (dim, warm lighting) can be applied, I can proceed without needing clarification. Step 4 - Final Verdict: The command is complete and safe to execute with the inferred default settings.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command can be executed with a safe default setting of dim, warm lighting.",
