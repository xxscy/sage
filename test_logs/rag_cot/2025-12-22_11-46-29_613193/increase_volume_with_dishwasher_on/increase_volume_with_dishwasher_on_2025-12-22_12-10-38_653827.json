Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since the command involves device control and lacks a specific parameter (the exact volume level to increase), I need to determine if a harmless default can be applied. In this case, there is no standard default for increasing volume in relation to the dishwasher's operation, which means I cannot proceed without clarification.
