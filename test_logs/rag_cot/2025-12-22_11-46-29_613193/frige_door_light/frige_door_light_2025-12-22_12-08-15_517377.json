Use the contactSensor capability from the refrigerator (Device ID: 51f02f33-4b43-11bf-2a6d-e7b5cf5be0ee) to monitor the state of the fridge door.\n2. When the contactSensor detects that the fridge door is opened, use the switch capability from any of the light strips (Device IDs: 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298, 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709, 571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d, c4b4a179-6f75-48ed-a6b3-95080be6afc6) to turn on the light.\nPlanner notes: The plan involves using the contact sensor on the refrigerator to detect when the door is opened. Once this event is triggered, the light in the dining room will be turned on using one of the available light strips. Since there are multiple light strips available, any of them can be used to execute the command. Further integration may be required to automate this process, as it involves monitoring the sensor state and responding accordingly. <FINISHED>",
