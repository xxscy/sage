I searched the TV Guide for any basketball games, but there was no specific game mentioned in the user's command. The only relevant game found was the NBA matchup between the Toronto Raptors and the Atlanta Hawks on Channel 7 (TSN 2), but since the user did not specify this game, I cannot confirm it as the intended request. Therefore, I marked the command as UNKNOWN_CHANNEL due to the lack of specificity.",
