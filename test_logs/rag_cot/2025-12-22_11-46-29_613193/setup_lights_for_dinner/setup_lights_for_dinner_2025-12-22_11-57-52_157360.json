Step 2 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` suggests dimming the lights and setting them to a warm color, which is a reasonable interpretation of the user's request. However, there is no specific preference provided by the user, and the content verification status indicates no verifiable match found. Step 3 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 2, since the request is Device Control and a specific parameter (like the exact brightness level or color temperature) is missing, I need to determine if a standard, harmless default can apply. In this case, a default of dimming the lights and setting them to a warm color is safe and reasonable. Step 4 - Final Verdict: Since a safe default can be applied, I do not need to ask for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nA safe default for dimming the lights and setting them to a warm color can be applied without needing user clarification.",

Optionally, use the `colorTemperature` capability to set a warm color temperature (e.g., around 2700K) for a cozy atmosphere.\n5. If desired, use the `colorControl` capability to set a specific color (e.g., soft yellow or orange) for the lights.\nPlanner notes: The plan involves checking the state of the lights to ensure they are on before adjusting their brightness and color settings. The meross-Light-Strip devices have multiple capabilities that allow for both brightness and color adjustments, making them suitable for creating a pleasant dining atmosphere. If any device fails to respond, we can try the next one in the list. Further disambiguation may be needed if the user has specific preferences for brightness or color. \n\n<FINISHED>",
