The most reasonable choice based on the context of brightness would be to adjust the one with the highest level (70) downwards.\n\n**Parameter Resolution**:\n- The command indicates that it is \"too bright,\" suggesting a need to decrease the brightness. The current highest level is 70, which is quite bright. A reasonable adjustment could be to lower it to a more comfortable level, such as 40.\n\n**Content Resolution**:\n- The command does not specify a particular color or temperature preference, so we will maintain the current color setting and only adjust the brightness.\n\n**Refined Command**: \"Lower the brightness of the meross-Light-Strip in the dining room to 40.\"\n\n**Risk Assessment**: Low - This is a reversible action involving a light adjustment.\n\n**Confidence**: High - The intent is clear, and the action is straightforward based on the provided context and device capabilities.",
