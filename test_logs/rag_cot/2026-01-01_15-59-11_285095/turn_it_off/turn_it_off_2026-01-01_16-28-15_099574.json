However, there are two active light strips (meross-Light-Strip) that can be turned off, while the c2c-switch is already off. \n- Given that the meross-Light-Strips are currently on, they are the most relevant devices to consider for the command.\n\n**Parameter Resolution**:\n- Since there are two meross-Light-Strips, I will choose the first one (22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298) as it is the first in the list and has a higher brightness level (70) compared to the second one (48). This choice is based on the assumption that the user may want to turn off the most prominent light.\n\n**Content Resolution**:\n- The command does not specify any additional parameters, so the default action will be to turn off the selected light strip.\n\n**Refined Command**: \"Turn off the meross-Light-Strip.\"\n\n**Risk Assessment**: Low - Turning off a light is a reversible action.\n\n**Confidence**: High - The intent is clear in the context of device control, and the most reasonable device has been selected based on the available information.",
