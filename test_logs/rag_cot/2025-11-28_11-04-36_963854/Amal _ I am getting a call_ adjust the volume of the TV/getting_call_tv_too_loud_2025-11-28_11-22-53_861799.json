  "environment_overview": "1) Two TVs have been detected in the environment: the Samsung The Frame (49) and the Samsung 8 Series (82). Both devices support capabilities such as power switching, audio volume adjustment, and media playback commands. The Samsung The Frame is currently set to HDMI4 as its input source, while the Samsung 8 Series is using digital TV as its input source.\n\n2) The current volume levels for the TVs are 6 for the Samsung The Frame and 75 for the Samsung 8 Series. Both TVs are capable of being powered on if they are off, and the volume can be adjusted using their audioVolume capability. The Samsung The Frame is in a state that supports media playback commands, while the Samsung 8 Series is also ready for media playback. Adjustments can be made to either TV's volume as needed.",
