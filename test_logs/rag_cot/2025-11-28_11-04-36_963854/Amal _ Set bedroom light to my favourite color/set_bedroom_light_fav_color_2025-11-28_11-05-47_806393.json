Each light strip has capabilities for switching on/off, adjusting brightness (switchLevel), controlling color temperature, and color control.

The third light strip (571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d) is also on, with a brightness level of 35 and a color temperature of 2300K. Actionable controls include turning the off light on, adjusting brightness levels, and changing color settings as per user preference.",
