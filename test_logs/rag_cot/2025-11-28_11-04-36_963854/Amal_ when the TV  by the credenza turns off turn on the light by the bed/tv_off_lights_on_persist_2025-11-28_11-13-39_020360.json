The TV is currently off, and there are multiple light strips available, but it's unclear which one is by the bed. \nStep 2 - Intent inference: The user wants the light by the bed to turn on automatically when the TV turns off, indicating a desire for a seamless transition in lighting based on the TV's state.\nStep 3 - Gap handling: The objective gap is the identification of which light strip is by the bed, while the subjective gap is the user's preference for light settings. The plan will default to turning on the first identified light strip if the specific one cannot be determined.\nStep 4 - Ambiguity check: There is ambiguity regarding which light strip is by the bed, as multiple light strips are available.
