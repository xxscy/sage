  "environment_overview": "1) The detected devices include three meross Light Strips, each capable of switching, adjusting switch levels, and color control. The first Light Strip (ID: 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298) and the third Light Strip (ID: 571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d) are both set to a switch level of 20, indicating they are likely dim. The second Light Strip (ID: 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709) is set to a switch level of 90, suggesting it is not dim. \n\n2) The current states of the devices show that the first and third Light Strips are powered on but at a low brightness level (20), while the second Light Strip is powered on at a higher brightness level (90). Actionable controls include the ability to turn off the first and third Light Strips, as they meet the criteria for being dim. The other devices, such as the Samsung TVs and refrigerator, are powered on, but their specific controls (volume, input source, mode) are not relevant to the current command regarding the dim lights.",
