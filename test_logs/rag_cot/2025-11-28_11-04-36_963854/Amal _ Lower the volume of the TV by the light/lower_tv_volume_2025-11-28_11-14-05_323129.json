  "environment_overview": "1) Two TVs have been detected in the environment: the Samsung The Frame (49) and the Samsung 8 Series (82). Both devices support capabilities such as audio volume control, power switching, and media playback commands. The Samsung The Frame is currently set to HDMI4 as its input source, while the Samsung 8 Series is using digital TV as its input source.\n\n2) The current state of the Samsung The Frame shows it is powered on with a volume level of 6. The Samsung 8 Series is also powered on, with a higher volume level of 50. Actionable controls include the ability to lower the volume on both TVs, as well as the option to power them on if they were off, although both are currently on.",
