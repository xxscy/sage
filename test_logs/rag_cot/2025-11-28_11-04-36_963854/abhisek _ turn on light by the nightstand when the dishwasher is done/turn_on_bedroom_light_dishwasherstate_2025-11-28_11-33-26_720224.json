These devices possess capabilities such as switching on/off, adjusting brightness (switchLevel), and controlling color (colorControl). Additionally, there is a Samsung dishwasher present, which is currently off, and several Samsung TVs that are operational.\n\n2) The current states of the devices indicate that the meross-Light-Strip devices are primarily off, with some exceptions where they are on. The dishwasher is off, which means it is not yet complete. The Samsung TVs are all on, indicating they are active. Actionable controls include turning on the meross-Light-Strip devices, adjusting their brightness, and potentially changing their color settings once the dishwasher is done.",
