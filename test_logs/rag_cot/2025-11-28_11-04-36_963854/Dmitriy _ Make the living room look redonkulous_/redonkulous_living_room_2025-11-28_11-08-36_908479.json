The second light strip (363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709) is off with no color or saturation settings applied. The third light strip (571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d) is on with a brightness level of 35 and is also set to a saturated color (color=1). Actionable controls include turning on the second light strip, adjusting the color and brightness of the active strips, and potentially setting a specific color temperature if desired.",
