It is located in the pantry area, specifically identified as \"FLEX_CRISPER.\" The refrigerator also includes components like an icemaker and a scale, although some capabilities related to meat aging and food defrosting are disabled.\n\n2) The current state of the Samsung refrigerator indicates a temperature of 11°C. The device is powered on, and while it supports temperature measurement, there are no additional actionable controls specified for volume, input source, or mode. If adjustments to the temperature are required, further instructions would be needed to set the thermostat cooling setpoint.",
