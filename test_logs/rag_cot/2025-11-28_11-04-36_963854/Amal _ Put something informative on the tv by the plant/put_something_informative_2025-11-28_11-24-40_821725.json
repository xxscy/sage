Both devices support various media playback commands and can be controlled via OCF (Open Connectivity Foundation) protocols.\n\n2) The current state of the Samsung The Frame (49) is off, with a volume level of 6, unmuted, and set to HDMI4 as the input source. The Samsung 8 Series (82) is on, with the volume muted and set to digital TV as the input source.
