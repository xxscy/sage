The 8 Series also supports similar capabilities but is currently set to receive input only from digital TV.\n\n2) The current state of the Samsung The Frame (49) is powered on, while the Samsung 8 Series (82) is powered off. Actionable controls for both devices include the ability to switch power on/off. The Frame can also adjust audio volume and switch between input sources, while the 8 Series can only be switched on to receive digital TV input.",
