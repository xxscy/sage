The specific light strips identified are: 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298, 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709, and 571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d. These devices are capable of being controlled based on user commands to enhance the lighting environment.\n\n2) The current states of the identified light strips are as follows: two are currently switched on (22e11820 and 363f714d), while one is switched off (571f0327). The refrigerator is also switched on, with its door currently closed. Actionable controls for the light strips include turning them on or off, adjusting brightness levels, and modifying color settings if desired. The refrigerator's state indicates it is operational, but no specific actions are required at this moment.",
