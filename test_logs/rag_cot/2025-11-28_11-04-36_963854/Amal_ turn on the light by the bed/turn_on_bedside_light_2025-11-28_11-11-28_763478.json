  "environment_overview": "1) The detected devices include multiple meross-Light-Strip units, which are likely positioned in various locations, including by the bed. These devices have capabilities such as switching on/off, adjusting brightness (switchLevel), and controlling color (colorControl). The specific devices identified are: meross-Light-Strip (22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298), meross-Light-Strip (363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709), and meross-Light-Strip (571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d), all of which can be controlled for lighting purposes.\n\n2) The current states of the meross-Light-Strip devices indicate that all are currently switched off. The actionable controls available include turning on the switches for each of the light strips. Additionally, the switch levels for the devices vary, with levels at 70, 48, and 35, which can be adjusted if desired. Other devices in the environment, such as TVs and a refrigerator, are in operational states, but the focus remains on activating the light strips as per the user command.",
