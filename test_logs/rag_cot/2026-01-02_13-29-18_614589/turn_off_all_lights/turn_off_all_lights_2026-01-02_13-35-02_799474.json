This is a reasonable assumption based on common practices for dimming lights.\n   - Since the command is to dim all lights, and the context provides a clear understanding of the action to be taken, the parameters can be considered complete.\n\n3. **Decision:**\n   - The target (all meross Light Strips) is identifiable, and the parameters (dim to a low level) are complete and inferable.\n\n**Decision:** ACT  \n**Question:** ",
