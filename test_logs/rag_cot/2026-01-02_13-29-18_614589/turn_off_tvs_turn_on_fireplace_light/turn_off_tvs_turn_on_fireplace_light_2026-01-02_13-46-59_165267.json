Both are clearly identified by their brand and model.\n   - The command also refers to a fireplace light, which is not explicitly listed in the device context but can be inferred as a separate device.\n\n2. **Inferring Parameters:**\n   - The command does not specify which fireplace light to switch on, but since there is only one fireplace light implied in the context, it can be inferred that this is the intended target.\n   - The command to turn off the TVs is clear, and both TVs are currently on, making the action straightforward.\n\n3. **Risk Assessment:**\n   - The action of turning off the TVs is low-risk.\n   - The action of switching on the fireplace light carries medium risk, but since the command is clear and the context suggests it is safe to proceed, I can execute the command.\n\nSince both the target devices (the two TVs and the fireplace light) are identifiable and the parameters for the actions are complete, I can proceed with executing the command.\n\n**Decision:** ACT  \n**Question:** ",
