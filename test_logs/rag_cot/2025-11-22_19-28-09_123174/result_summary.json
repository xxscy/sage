The key action is \"change\" and the context is related to sleep.\n\nStep 2 - Deep intent inference: Given that Amal is going to sleep, the likely intent is to create a conducive environment for sleep. Based on the retrieved preferences, Amal prefers red light for better sleep quality.

However, since there is no information about Amal's favorite color in the retrieved preferences or history, I cannot determine what color to set the light to. The command implies a desire for personalization, but the lack of specific color information creates a gap.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The specific information missing is Amal's favorite color. This cannot be inferred from common sense or situational context, as there are no historical interactions or preferences available that indicate what color Amal prefers.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity arises from the phrase \"my favourite color,\" which cannot be resolved without additional information about what that color is. \n\nStep 5 - Decision: \n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nI need to ask Amal for clarification on what their favorite color is, as this information is essential to fulfill the command and cannot be inferred from the available data.\n```",

The command implies a desire for personalization, but the lack of specific color information creates a gap.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The specific information missing is Amal's favorite color. This cannot be inferred from common sense or situational context, as there are no historical interactions or preferences available that indicate what color Amal prefers.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity arises from the phrase \"my favourite color,\" which cannot be resolved without additional information about what that color is. \n\nStep 5 - Decision: \n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nI need to ask Amal for clarification on what their favorite color is, as this information is essential to fulfill the command and cannot be inferred from the available data.\n```",

This implies that the TV should be turned on and set to the appropriate channel or input source for the game. The context suggests that the user is ready to engage with the game, indicating a desire for immediate action.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which game or channel to tune into. However, it is reasonable to infer that the user expects the TV to be set to a sports channel or input where the game is available. This can be inferred from common sense, as games are typically associated with specific channels.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is ambiguity regarding which game to put on, but this is not a blocking issue since the user likely expects the assistant to find the game based on common sports channels or recent viewing history.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear in its intent to watch a game on the TV, and while the specific game is not mentioned, it can be reasonably inferred that the assistant should tune into a sports channel or input where the game is likely to be found.\n```",

The term \"redonkulous\" implies a desire for something visually striking or over-the-top, which could mean bright colors or dynamic lighting effects. Given that there are no specific preferences for living room lighting retrieved, I need to infer a suitable action based on common sense.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: There is no specific information about Dmitriy's preferences for living room lighting.

A reasonable default action would be to set the lights to a bright, colorful mode.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The command is somewhat ambiguous due to the lack of specific details about what \"redonkulous\" entails in terms of lighting.

Given the context of a smart home, common devices that might need to be turned off include lights, a TV, or other appliances. The lack of specific context (like \"it's too bright\" or \"the TV is on\") makes it difficult to determine which device the user is referring to.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command lacks clarity on which device to turn off. There are multiple devices in the environment (TV, refrigerator, dishwasher, etc.), but no specific reference is made. This ambiguity cannot be resolved through common sense or defaults since \"it\" could refer to any of the devices.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The ambiguity regarding the pronoun \"it\" is indeed blocking the ability to execute the command effectively.

The phrase \"by the light\" could imply that the user wants to adjust the volume in relation to the lighting conditions, but it is unclear how light relates to volume adjustment. Given that there is no indication of a specific situation (like a call or going to sleep), the most reasonable action is to lower the volume.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify how much to lower the volume, but common sense suggests a moderate reduction (e.g., 50% or a reasonable decrement). There is no historical preference for volume adjustment to guide this.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The phrase \"by the light\" introduces ambiguity regarding the user's intent. It is unclear if the user wants the volume lowered in a specific way related to lighting or if it is simply a miscommunication.

Additionally, the request to \"dim the lights by the TV\" suggests that the user may want a more comfortable viewing environment, likely because the lights are currently too bright.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which game or channel to put on the TV. However, it can be inferred that the user likely wants to watch a sports game, which is a common context for such a request.

Additionally, the request to \"dim the lights by the TV\" suggests that the user may want a more comfortable viewing environment, likely because the lights are currently too bright.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which game or channel to put on the TV. However, it can be inferred that the user likely wants to watch a sports game, which is a common context for such a request. The action of dimming the lights is clear, as it implies reducing brightness for comfort.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: The reference to \"the game\" is somewhat ambiguous, but given the context of watching TV, it is reasonable to assume it refers to a sports game.

The phrase \"appropriate mode\" implies that the user expects the dishwasher to have a specific setting that is suitable for this type of cleaning, which is typically a heavy or intensive wash cycle.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which mode to set, but common sense suggests that for greasy dishes, an intensive wash mode is appropriate. The dishwasher's current state indicates it is stopped, so it can be set to a new mode.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: There is no ambiguity in the command regarding what the user wants. The context clearly indicates that the user wants to set the dishwasher to a mode that can handle greasy dishes, which can be inferred as an intensive wash.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe user's intent is clear, and the appropriate action can be inferred as setting the dishwasher to an intensive wash mode for greasy dishes without needing further clarification.\n```",
