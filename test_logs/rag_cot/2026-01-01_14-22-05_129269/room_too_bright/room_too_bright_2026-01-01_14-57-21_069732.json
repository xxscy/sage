  "intent_analysis": "**Intent Classification**: Device Control\n\n**Device Resolution**:\n- **Location cues**: The command specifies the \"dining room,\" but there are no explicit location identifiers for the devices.\n- **Type cues**: The command relates to lighting, and there are three meross light strips available.\n- **State cues**: All devices are currently on, with varying brightness levels (70, 48, and 35).\n- **Multiple devices**: The most recent or most accessible device is preferred. Since there is no specific recent usage data, I will choose the device with the lowest brightness level, which is likely to be the most suitable for reducing brightness.\n\n**Parameter Resolution**:\n- The command indicates that it is \"too bright,\" suggesting a need to lower the brightness. The current levels are 70, 48, and 35. The device with the lowest brightness (35) can be adjusted further down.\n\n**Content Resolution**:\n- The command does not specify a target brightness level, so I will infer a reasonable adjustment. A common adjustment for reducing brightness could be to lower it by 20% or to a level that is comfortable for general use. Given the current level of 35, I will set it to a lower level of 20.\n\n**Refined Command**: \"Lower the brightness of the meross-Light-Strip in the dining room to 20.\"\n\n**Risk Assessment**: Low - This is a reversible action involving a light adjustment.\n\n**Confidence**: High - The intent is clear, and the device context supports the action.",
