Step 4 - The content source is unverified, as the type of game is unspecified. Step 5 - There are no subjective descriptors present in the command. Step 6 - Given the lack of context to resolve the ambiguity regarding the game type, I need to ask for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to the unspecified game type, and there is no context available to infer the user's preference, necessitating clarification.",

The device identified for the command is the Samsung 8 Series (82) TV, but since the type of game is not provided and there are no historical preferences or context to infer it from, this results in an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for the game type. Therefore, the command cannot be executed as requested, leading to a low confidence rating.",
