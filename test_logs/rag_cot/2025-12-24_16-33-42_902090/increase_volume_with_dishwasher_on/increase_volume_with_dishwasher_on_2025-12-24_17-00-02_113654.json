Step 3 - The `Refined Command` contains markers for `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER` (volume increase preference) and `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` (which TV to control). The context does not provide sufficient information to resolve these ambiguities, as there are two TVs present and no specified volume level. Step 4 - Content verification is not applicable as there is no content to verify. Step 5 - There are no subjective descriptors present in the command. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity regarding which TV to control and the lack of a specified volume increase preference, human interaction is necessary.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to the presence of two TVs and the unspecified volume increase preference, which cannot be resolved with the available context.",

  "intent_analysis": "- **Request Type**: Device Control\n- **Identified Situation**: The user wants to increase the volume of the TV when the dishwasher is running.\n- **Content Verification**: No verifiable match found\n- **Refined Command**: Increase the volume of the TV by the credenza whenever the dishwasher is running. [UNKNOWN_PARAMETER]\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The command specifies increasing the volume of the TV, but there is no explicit preference for the volume level to increase to, nor is there a current state of the dishwasher indicating it is running. The TV is currently on, but the dishwasher is off, which means the command cannot be executed as intended. Additionally, there are two TVs present, which creates ambiguity regarding which TV to control. Therefore, the command includes an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER marker for the volume increase preference and an AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE marker for the TV selection.",
