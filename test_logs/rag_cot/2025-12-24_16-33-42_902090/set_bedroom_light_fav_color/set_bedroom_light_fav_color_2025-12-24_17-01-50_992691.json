Therefore, the ambiguity remains unresolved. Step 4 - Content verification is not applicable here as the command does not involve unverified content. Step 5 - There are no subjective descriptors that need mapping. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity regarding which device to control, I need to ask for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to multiple instances of the \"meross-Light-Strip\" without clear identification of which one to control, necessitating user clarification.",

However, there are multiple instances of the \"meross-Light-Strip\" device, and the command does not specify which one to control. Therefore, I marked the target as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. The command to set the color to red is valid based on the user's preference, but without a clear identification of which light to control, the confidence is low.",
