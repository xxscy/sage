Step 2 - There are no collective references present in the command, so I continue. Step 3 - The `Refined Command` contains an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for the game to put on the TV. The context does not provide a specific game, as the user enjoys soccer and basketball but has not specified which game to display. Therefore, I cannot resolve this ambiguity with the available context. Step 4 - Content verification is not applicable here as there is no verifiable source found for the game. Step 5 - There are no subjective descriptors present in the command.

  "intent_analysis": "- **Request Type**: Device Control\n- **Identified Situation**: User wants to put a game on the TV by the credenza and dim the lights in that area. The specific game is not mentioned, but the user enjoys soccer and basketball.\n- **Content Verification**: No verifiable match found\n- **Refined Command**: Dim the lights by the TV. UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for the game to put on the TV.\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The command involves two actions: dimming the lights and putting a game on the TV. The lights can be dimmed as the user did not specify a personal preference for the dimming level, so a safe default can be applied. However, the specific game to put on the TV is not mentioned, and there is no verifiable source found in the TV Guide for a game currently available. Therefore, this parameter is marked as UNKNOWN_PARAMETER. The TV by the credenza is identified as the target for the lights, but the game remains ambiguous due to lack of specific information.",
