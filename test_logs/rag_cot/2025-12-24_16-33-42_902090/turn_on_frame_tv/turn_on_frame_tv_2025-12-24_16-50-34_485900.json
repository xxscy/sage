Step 2 - There are no collective references present in the command, so I continue. Step 3 - The `Refined Command` contains `UNKNOWN_CHANNEL`, and while the Frame TV can be turned on, the specific channel cannot be confirmed due to the lack of verifiable information. Additionally, there are two TVs present, but the command does not specify which one to turn on, leading to ambiguity. Therefore, context does not resolve the ambiguity. Step 4 - Content verification is needed as there is no verifiable match found for Channel 5. Step 5 - There are no subjective descriptors to evaluate. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity regarding the channel and the unspecified TV, I conclude that human interaction is necessary.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to the unverified channel and the presence of two TVs without specification, necessitating clarification from the user.",

However, the TV Guide does not list Channel 5, and there is no historical data or user preferences to verify this channel. The Frame TV is currently off, and while it can be turned on, the specific channel cannot be confirmed, leading to the use of UNKNOWN_CHANNEL in the command. Additionally, there are two TVs present, but the command does not specify which one to turn on, leading to ambiguity. Therefore, the command is marked as having low confidence due to the lack of verifiable channel information and the ambiguity of the device.",
