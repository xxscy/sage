  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command is not an information request; it is a directive to play content. Step 2 - There are no collective references present in the command. Step 3 - The `Refined Command` specifies a clear action to put the game on a specific channel, and the context (the TV by the credenza) resolves any ambiguity regarding the device. Step 4 - The content source (Channel 7 TSN 2) has been verified as broadcasting the game, so no further verification is needed. Step 5 - There are no subjective descriptors in the command that require mapping from user preferences. Step 6 - All checks indicate that the command can be executed without ambiguity.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is clear, the device is identified through context, and the content source is verified, leading to a high confidence in executing the command without further interaction.",
