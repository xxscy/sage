There is no information in the user preferences or history to determine what \"sleep mode\" entails, leading to an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER. Additionally, there are multiple light strips available, but no specific context to identify which one to control, resulting in an AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE situation. Thus, the command cannot be executed with certainty.",
