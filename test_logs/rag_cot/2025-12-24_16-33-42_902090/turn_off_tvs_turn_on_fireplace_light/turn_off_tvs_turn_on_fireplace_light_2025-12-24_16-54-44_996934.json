  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command does not retrieve or report information, so this check is not applicable. Step 2 - The command uses \"all\" to refer to the TVs, which is a collective reference, so this check is satisfied and we do not need to ask for clarification on that part. Step 3 - The `Refined Command` contains an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for the fireplace light, and there is no context provided that clearly identifies the fireplace light or resolves this ambiguity. Step 4 - Content verification is not applicable here as there is no verifiable source found. Step 5 - There are no subjective descriptors present in the command. Step 6 - Given the context and checks, the ambiguity regarding the fireplace light remains unresolved.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command to switch on the fireplace light has an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER, and there is insufficient context to resolve this ambiguity, necessitating human interaction for clarification.",

However, the command to switch on the fireplace light lacks a verifiable source or specific parameters, leading to an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for the fireplace light. Thus, the confidence is low due to the missing parameter.",
