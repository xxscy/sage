The device lookup shows multiple meross-Light-Strips, which are all currently on but have different brightness levels. Since the command does not specify which light to adjust and there is no context to resolve this ambiguity, I must mark the command as targeting all matching devices. Additionally, the lack of a specified brightness level leads to an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for the desired brightness.",
