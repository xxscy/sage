However, there are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices available, leading to ambiguity in targeting a specific device. Therefore, I marked the command as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. Additionally, while I suggested a warm color and dimming, the specific preference for the level of dimming is not retrievable from the user's history or preferences, leading to a low confidence rating.",
