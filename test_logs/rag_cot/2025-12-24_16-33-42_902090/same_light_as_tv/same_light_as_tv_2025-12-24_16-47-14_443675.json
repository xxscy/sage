  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command does not retrieve or report information, so I proceed to the next step. Step 2 - There are no collective references present in the command, so I continue. Step 3 - The `Refined Command` contains the marker `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`, and while there is an inferred preference for dim, warm temperature light, the specific device to control is not identified, leading to ambiguity. Therefore, context cannot resolve the ambiguity. Step 4 - Content verification is not applicable here as there is no content to verify. Step 5 - The subjective descriptor \"dim, warm temperature\" can be mapped from user preferences, so I do not need to ask about that. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity regarding the specific light device, I need to ask for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to the lack of a specified light device, and while there is a preference for dim, warm light, the specific device context does not resolve the ambiguity.",

Therefore, it is marked as UNKNOWN_PARAMETER. Additionally, there are multiple light devices available, but no specific device was identified in the command, leading to ambiguity.
