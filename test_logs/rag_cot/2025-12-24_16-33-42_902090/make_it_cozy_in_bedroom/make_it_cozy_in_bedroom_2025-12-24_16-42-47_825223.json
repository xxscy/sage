Step 2 - There are no collective references present in the command, so I continue. Step 3 - The `Refined Command` specifies a particular device (device ID: 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298) and the context of the user's preference for a cozy setting aligns with the identified device's capability to provide a dim, warm temperature light. Therefore, the context resolves any potential ambiguity. Step 4 - There is no content verification needed as the command is clear and actionable. Step 5 - The subjective descriptor \"cozy\" can be mapped to the user's preference for dim, warm light, so no further clarification is needed. Step 6 - Since the context clearly identifies the device and resolves any ambiguity, I do not need to ask for further clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is clear and actionable, with context resolving any potential ambiguity regarding the device and the user's preferences.",
