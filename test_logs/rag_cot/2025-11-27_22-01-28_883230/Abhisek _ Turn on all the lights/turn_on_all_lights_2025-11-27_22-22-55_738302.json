These devices are capable of switching on/off, adjusting brightness (switchLevel), and controlling color settings (colorTemperature and colorControl). Additionally, there are other devices such as Samsung TVs and a refrigerator, which also have switch capabilities.\n\n2) The current states of the meross Light Strips indicate that all are currently off. Specifically, the first Light Strip (22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298) is off, the second (363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709) is off, and the third (571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d) is also off. Actionable controls for these devices include the ability to turn them on using the switch capability. Other devices, such as the Samsung TVs and refrigerator, are currently on, while the dishwasher is off, indicating potential actions to turn on the lights and check the status of the other devices.",
