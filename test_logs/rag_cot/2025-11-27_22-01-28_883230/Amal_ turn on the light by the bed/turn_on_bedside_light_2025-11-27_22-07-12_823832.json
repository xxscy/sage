  "environment_overview": "1) The detected devices include multiple meross Light Strips, which are likely positioned in various locations, including near the bed as inferred from the user command. These light strips possess capabilities such as switching on/off, adjusting brightness (switchLevel), controlling color temperature, and color control. Additionally, there are other devices present, including Samsung TVs and a refrigerator, which also have specific functionalities.\n\n2) The current states of the devices indicate that all meross Light Strips are currently switched off. The Samsung TVs are operational, with one (Samsung The Frame, 49 inches) switched on, while the other (Samsung 8 Series, 82 inches) is also on. The dishwasher is off, and the refrigerator is on. Actionable controls for the light strips include turning them on using the switch capability, while the TVs can be controlled for power, volume, and input source adjustments.",
