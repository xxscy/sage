The Samsung The Frame is likely the one referred to as \"the TV by the credenza,\" given its active state and HDMI input capability. The Samsung 8 Series, on the other hand, is currently powered off and set to digital TV input.\n\n2) The Samsung The Frame (49) is currently powered on, with a volume level of 6 and is unmuted. It is set to HDMI4 as its input source, allowing for media playback commands such as play, pause, and stop. The Samsung 8 Series (82) is powered off, with a volume of 0 and muted, indicating it is not currently available for use. The actionable controls for the Samsung The Frame include switching power on/off, adjusting volume, and changing input sources.",
