  "environment_overview": "1) The detected devices include multiple meross-Light-Strip units, specifically identified by their unique IDs: 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298, 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709, and 571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d. Each of these devices has capabilities for switching, adjusting switch levels, color temperature, and color control. The context indicates that the focus is on lighting, specifically the switch capability of these light strips.\n\n2) The current states of the identified meross-Light-Strip devices show varying switch statuses. The devices with IDs 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298 and 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709 are currently switched on, while the device with ID 571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d is switched off. Actionable controls include the ability to turn on or off the light strips using their switch capability, with the first device in the sequence being the primary target for activation.",
