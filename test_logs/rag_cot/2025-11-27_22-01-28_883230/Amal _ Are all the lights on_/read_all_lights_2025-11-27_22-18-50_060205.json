The devices are identified by their unique IDs: 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298, 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709, and 571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d. Additionally, there are other devices such as a Samsung TV (The Frame and 8 Series), a Samsung refrigerator, and a dishwasher, which also have switching capabilities.\n\n2) The current states of the devices indicate that all three meross Light Strips are powered on, with brightness levels of 70, 48, and 35, respectively. The Samsung TVs are also on, while the refrigerator is powered on, and the dishwasher is off. Actionable controls include turning the lights on or off, adjusting brightness levels, and managing the power state of the TVs and refrigerator. The dishwasher can be turned on if needed.",
