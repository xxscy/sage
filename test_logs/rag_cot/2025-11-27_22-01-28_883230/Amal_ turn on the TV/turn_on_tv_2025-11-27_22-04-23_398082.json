The Samsung The Frame supports various capabilities including power switching, audio volume control, audio muting, and TV channel management. It is currently set to the HDMI4 input source. The Samsung 8 Series also supports similar capabilities but is currently set to the digital TV input source.\n\n2) The current state of the devices shows that the Samsung The Frame (49) is powered on, while the Samsung 8 Series (82) is powered off. Actionable controls for both devices include the ability to switch power on or off, adjust audio volume, and manage playback commands such as play, pause, and stop. The Samsung 8 Series can be turned on using its switch capability, while the Samsung The Frame is already active.",
