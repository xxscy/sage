Both devices support OCF capabilities, including audio volume control, audio mute, and media playback commands. The Frame is connected to HDMI4, while the 8 Series is set to digital TV. Both TVs can be powered on via OCF.\n\n2) The current volume for the Samsung The Frame (49) is set to 6, and for the Samsung 8 Series (82), it is at 75. Both TVs are in a media playback state, with the capability to adjust their volume. The planner will first check if either TV is powered on; if not, it will turn one on before adjusting the volume as per the user's request.",
