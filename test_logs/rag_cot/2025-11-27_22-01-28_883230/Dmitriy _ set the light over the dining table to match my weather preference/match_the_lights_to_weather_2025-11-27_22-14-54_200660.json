The available light strips are identified by their unique IDs: 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298, 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709, and 571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d. Each light strip has capabilities for switching on/off, adjusting brightness (switchLevel), and controlling color (colorTemperature and colorControl).\n\n2) Currently, all identified meross Light Strips are in the \"off\" state. The first light strip (22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298) has a brightness level of 70 and a color temperature of 2700K. The second light strip (363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709) is set to a brightness level of 48 with a color temperature of 7000K. The third light strip (571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d) has a brightness level of 35 and a color temperature of 2300K. Actionable controls include turning on the light strips and adjusting their brightness and color settings as needed.",
