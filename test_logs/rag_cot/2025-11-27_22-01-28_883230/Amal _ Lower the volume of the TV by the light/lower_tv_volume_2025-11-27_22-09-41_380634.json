Both devices are capable of audio volume control, power switching, and media playback. The Samsung The Frame is currently set to HDMI4 as its input source, while the Samsung 8 Series is using digital TV. Additionally, there are multiple light strips present, which are also capable of switching on/off and adjusting brightness levels.\n\n2) The current state of the Samsung The Frame (49) shows that it is powered on with a volume level of 6. The Samsung 8 Series (82) is also powered on, with a higher volume level of 50. Both TVs can be controlled to lower their volume. The light strips are all powered on, with varying brightness levels, allowing for potential adjustments if needed.",
