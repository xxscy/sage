The Samsung 8 Series TV is powered on (switch=on) but does not have a specific channel set. Actionable controls for the Samsung The Frame TV include turning it on and changing the channel to 5, while the Samsung 8 Series TV can be used as a backup if the first device fails to respond. Both TVs can adjust volume and mute audio as needed.",
