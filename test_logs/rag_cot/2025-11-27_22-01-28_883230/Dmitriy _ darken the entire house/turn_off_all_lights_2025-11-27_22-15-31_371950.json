  "environment_overview": "1) The detected devices include three meross-Light-Strip units identified by their unique IDs: 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298, 363f714d-e4fe-4052-a78c-f8c97542e709, and 571f0327-6507-4674-b9cf-fe68f7d9522d. These devices are capable of switching on/off, adjusting brightness levels, controlling color temperature, and managing color settings. They are likely distributed throughout the house, serving as ambient lighting sources.\n\n2) The current states of the devices are as follows: Device 22e11820 has a brightness level of 70 and is set to a color with saturation at 100. Device 363f714d is at a brightness level of 48 with no color settings applied. Device 571f0327 is at a brightness level of 35 and also has saturation at 100. The actionable controls include turning off the lights using the switch capability and adjusting the brightness to the lowest level using the switchLevel capability for each device.",
