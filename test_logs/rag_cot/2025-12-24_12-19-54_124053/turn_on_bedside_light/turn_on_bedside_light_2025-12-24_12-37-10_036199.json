Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` clearly identifies the device to be controlled. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Since the device is specified in the `Refined Command`, there is no need for further clarification. Step 6 - Final Verdict: The command is clear and actionable.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies a device clearly, and there is no ambiguity or need for further clarification.",

The device lookup results identified multiple meross-Light-Strips, but since the user did not specify which one, I used the first available device as the target.
