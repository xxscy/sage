Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates lowering the volume by 1, which is a clear action. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Since the command specifies a device and a clear action, I can proceed without needing further clarification. Step 6 - Final Verdict: The command is clear and actionable.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies a device and a clear action to lower the volume, which can be executed without further clarification.",

The current volume of the active TV, Samsung The Frame (49), is 6. Since the user did not specify a personal preference for the volume level, I applied a conservative default of lowering the volume by 1. The device is identified clearly as there is only one active TV in the context.",
