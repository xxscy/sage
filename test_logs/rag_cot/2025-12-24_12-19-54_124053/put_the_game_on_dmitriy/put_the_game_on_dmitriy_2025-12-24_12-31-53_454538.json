Step 2 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The `Refined Command` indicates a specific device, the TV by the credenza, so device ambiguity is resolved. Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is a Content Consumption request. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is marked as UNKNOWN_CHANNEL due to the lack of a specific game or team preference. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Since the `Refined Command` does not specify a verifiable source, I must ask for clarification. Step 6 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required due to the UNKNOWN_CHANNEL status.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command lacks a specific game or team preference, making it impossible to determine what to play on the TV.",
