Step 2 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The `Refined Command` specifies the device as \"meross-Light-Strip\" in the dining room, confirming that device ambiguity is resolved. Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is a Device Control request. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates a specific action to be taken with a specific device, and there are no unverified assumptions present. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Since the device is specified and the command is clear, I can proceed with the action without needing further clarification. Step 6 - Final Verdict: The command is clear and actionable.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies a device and action clearly, allowing for execution without further clarification.",
