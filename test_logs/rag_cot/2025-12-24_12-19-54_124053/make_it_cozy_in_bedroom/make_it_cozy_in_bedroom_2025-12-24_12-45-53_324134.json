  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it is a command to control a device. Step 2 - Use Intent Analysis Results: The `Refined Command` specifies the device as the meross-Light-Strip in the bedroom, confirming that device ambiguity is resolved. Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is clear and specifies the desired action without ambiguity. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Since the device is specified and the command is clear, I can proceed with the action. Step 6 - Final Verdict: The command is straightforward and does not require further clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies a device and a clear action, allowing for direct execution without ambiguity.",
