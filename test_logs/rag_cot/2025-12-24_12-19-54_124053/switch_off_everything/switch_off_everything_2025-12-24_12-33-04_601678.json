Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` clearly specifies the devices to be turned off, so no further analysis is needed. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Since the `Refined Command` specifies devices, device ambiguity is resolved, and I can proceed with the command.

The device lookup results show two meross-Light-Strips that are currently on (one at level 70 and the other at level 48) and one c2c-switch that is already off. Since there are no explicit preferences for which devices to turn off, I included all active devices in the command.",
