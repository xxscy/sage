Step 3 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 4 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is clear and specifies the action to be taken with the identified device. Step 5 - Apply Logic: Since the `Refined Command` specifies a device, device ambiguity is resolved, and the command can be executed as intended. Step 6 - Final Verdict: No further clarification is needed as the command is clear and actionable.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies the device to be controlled, and the action can be executed based on the state of the dishwasher without requiring additional input.",

The meross-Light-Strip is identified as the light device available. Since there is no specific user preference for the light's state or level when turned on, a conservative default is applied, which is to simply turn it on without specifying a level or color. The dishwasher's state is not currently available, but the command is structured to activate the light when the dishwasher completes its cycle.",
