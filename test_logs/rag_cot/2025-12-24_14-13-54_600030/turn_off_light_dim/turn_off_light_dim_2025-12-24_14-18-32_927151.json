  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command is a device control request, not an information request. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, which is a mandatory marker indicating the need for clarification. Step 3 - The command refers to \"all the lights that are dim,\" but there are multiple light strips with varying brightness levels, making the target ambiguous. Step 4 - There are no specific parameters or preferences provided by the user regarding which dim lights to turn off. Step 5 - The intent is clear, but the ambiguity in the device reference and lack of specific parameters necessitate further clarification. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the need for accurate execution, I conclude that clarification is required.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to multiple devices fitting the description of \"dim lights,\" and there are no specific preferences or parameters provided by the user to determine which lights to turn off.",

Since the command implies a singular target but multiple devices fit the description, I marked the target as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. There is no specific command history or preference related to dimming lights or turning off specific types of lights, leading to the conclusion that the command cannot be executed without further clarification.",
