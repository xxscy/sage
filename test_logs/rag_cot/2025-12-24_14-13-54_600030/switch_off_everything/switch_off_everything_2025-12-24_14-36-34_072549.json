  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command is a device control request, not an information request. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` due to multiple active light strips, which is a mandatory marker indicating the need for clarification. Step 3 - There is no singular reference; however, the presence of multiple devices makes it necessary to clarify which devices the user considers non-essential. Step 4 - The command lacks specific criteria or preferences for determining which devices to turn off, indicating a missing parameter. Step 5 - The intent is clear in wanting to turn off devices, but the ambiguity regarding which devices are considered non-essential requires further clarification. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the need for specific device identification, human interaction is necessary.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to multiple active devices that could be classified as non-essential, and the user has not provided specific criteria for which devices to turn off.

Marked as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE due to multiple active light strips.\n- **Confidence**: Low (Unverified Content/Ambiguous Target)\n- **Reasoning**: The user requested to turn off all non-essential devices. There are multiple devices (two active meross-Light-Strips) that could be considered non-essential, but no specific preferences or criteria were provided to determine which devices to turn off. Therefore, the command is marked as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. No verifiable content consumption request was made, so the command is focused solely on device control.",
