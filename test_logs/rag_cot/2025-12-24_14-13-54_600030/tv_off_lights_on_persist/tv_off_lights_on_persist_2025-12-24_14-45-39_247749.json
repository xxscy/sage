Step 4 - There are no missing parameters in the command, as the user has specified the action clearly. Step 5 - The intent is to control the light based on the TV's state, but due to the ambiguity regarding which light to turn on, I must seek clarification. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the need for accurate device control, I conclude that clarification is necessary.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command involves controlling a light device that is ambiguous due to the presence of two identical devices.

The TV is identified as \"Samsung The Frame (49)\" which is currently off. The light is identified as \"meross-Light-Strip,\" but there are two identical devices, making it ambiguous which one to control. Therefore, the light is marked as **AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE**.
