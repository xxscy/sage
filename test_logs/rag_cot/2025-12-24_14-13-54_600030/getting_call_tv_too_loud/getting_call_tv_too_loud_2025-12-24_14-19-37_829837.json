  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command does not retrieve or report information, so I proceed to the next step. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` since there are two TVs, but the command does not specify which one to adjust. Therefore, I need clarification. Step 3 - There is a singular reference to \"the TV,\" but multiple TVs exist, confirming the need for clarification. Step 4 - The command lacks a specific volume level or preference, which is a required parameter for the action. Step 5 - The intent is to adjust the volume, but without knowing which TV to adjust or what volume level is preferred, I cannot proceed safely. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and lack of specific parameters, I conclude that I need to ask for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to the presence of multiple TVs and the lack of a specified volume level or preference, necessitating clarification before proceeding.",
