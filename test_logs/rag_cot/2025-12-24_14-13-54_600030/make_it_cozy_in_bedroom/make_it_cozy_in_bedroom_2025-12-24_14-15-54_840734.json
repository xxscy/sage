  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command is a device control request, not an information request. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` does not contain `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` or `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`, so this check is passed. Step 3 - The command refers to \"the lights\" in the bedroom, but there are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices, which creates ambiguity. Step 4 - The command specifies a cozy setting, which is subjective, but the level of 35 is inferred from the user's preference. However, the specific device to control is not clearly identified. Step 5 - The intent is clear, but the ambiguity regarding which device to control remains. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity regarding the specific device, I need to ask for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: There is ambiguity regarding which specific meross-Light-Strip device to control in the bedroom, as multiple devices exist.

The device lookup indicates multiple meross-Light-Strip devices, but the VLM disambiguation suggests using the device with ID 22e11820-64fa-4bed-ad8f-f98ef66de298, which is currently off. The command sets the light to a level of 35, which is inferred as a dim setting based on the user's preference.",
