  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command does not request information, so I proceed to the next step. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` since there are two active TVs, which necessitates clarification. Step 3 - The command refers to \"the TV,\" but there are multiple TVs, confirming the need for clarification. Step 4 - The command does not specify a user preference for the volume level, which is a required parameter, indicating a gap. Step 5 - The intent is to control the TV's volume based on the dishwasher's state, but the ambiguity regarding which TV to control and the missing volume preference leads to uncertainty. Step 6 - Given the identified ambiguities and gaps, I conclude that clarification is necessary.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to multiple TVs being present and a lack of specified volume preference, requiring clarification to ensure accurate execution.",

  "intent_analysis": "- **Request Type**: Device Control\n- **Identified Situation**: The user wants to increase the volume of the TV when the dishwasher is running.\n- **Content Verification**: No verifiable match found\n- **Refined Command**: Increase the volume of the TV by the credenza to a safe default level of 10 whenever the dishwasher is running.\n- **Confidence**: Low (Unverified Content/Ambiguous Target)\n- **Reasoning**: The command involves controlling the TV's volume based on the state of the dishwasher. The dishwasher is currently off, and there is no specific user preference for the volume level. Therefore, I applied a conservative default volume level of 10. The TV is ambiguous as there are two active TVs, and the command does not specify which one to control, hence marked as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE.",
