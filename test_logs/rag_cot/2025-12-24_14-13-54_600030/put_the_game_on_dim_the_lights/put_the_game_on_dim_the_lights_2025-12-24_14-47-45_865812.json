Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` (two active light strips) and `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER` (the game/channel is not specified), which are mandatory markers indicating the need for clarification. Step 3 - There is a singular reference to \"the lights\" while multiple devices exist, confirming the need for clarification. Step 4 - The command lacks a specific level for dimming the lights, which is a required parameter. Step 5 - The intent is to control devices, but due to the ambiguity and missing parameters, I cannot proceed without further information. Step 6 - Given the low confidence and multiple ambiguities, I conclude that clarification is necessary.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command contains ambiguous references to devices and lacks specific parameters, making it impossible to execute accurately without further clarification.",

  "intent_analysis": "- **Request Type**: Device Control\n- **Identified Situation**: User wants to put a game on the TV by the credenza and dim the lights by the TV.\n- **Content Verification**: No verifiable match found\n- **Refined Command**: Set the TV by the credenza to UNKNOWN_CHANNEL and dim the lights by the meross-Light-Strip to a lower level.\n- **Confidence**: Low (Unverified Content/Ambiguous Target)\n- **Reasoning**: The command references putting a game on the TV, but no specific game or channel was provided, and the TV Guide does not indicate a current game. Therefore, the channel is marked as UNKNOWN_CHANNEL. The command to dim the lights is executed, but the specific level is not defined, so I will apply a conservative default to dim the lights. The meross-Light-Strip is identified, but since there are two active light strips, the target for dimming is marked as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE.",
