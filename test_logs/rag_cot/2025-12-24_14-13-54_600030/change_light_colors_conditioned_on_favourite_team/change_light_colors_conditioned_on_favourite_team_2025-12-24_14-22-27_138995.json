  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command is a device control request, not an information request. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains both `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` (multiple light strips) and `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER` (specific color representation for the Montreal Canadiens is not provided). Step 3 - There is no singular reference; however, the presence of multiple devices leads to ambiguity. Step 4 - The command lacks specific color parameters to represent the Montreal Canadiens, which is a required parameter. Step 5 - The intent is clear, but the execution is hindered by the lack of specific color information and the ambiguity of the devices involved. Step 6 - Given the identified ambiguities and missing parameters, clarification is necessary.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to multiple light strips being referenced and the absence of specific color parameters to represent the Montreal Canadiens.

However, the specific color or representation for the Montreal Canadiens is not provided, and there is no verifiable source for the color settings. Therefore, the command is issued without specific color parameters, marking the preference as `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`.
