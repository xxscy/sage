Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, indicating that there are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices available, which makes the target ambiguous. Step 3 - There is a singular reference to \"the light by the bed,\" but multiple devices exist, confirming the need for clarification. Step 4 - There are no missing parameters, but the ambiguity in device identification remains. Step 5 - The intent is to turn on a light, but without knowing which specific light, the command cannot be executed accurately. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the need for clarification, I will proceed with the requirement for human interaction.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to multiple meross-Light-Strip devices being present, and I need clarification on which specific light the user intends to control.",
