Step 2 - The `Refined Command` does not contain `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` or `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`, so no mandatory checks are needed here. Step 3 - The command specifies \"the TV by the plant,\" which implies a singular device, so there is no ambiguity in device reference. Step 4 - There are no missing parameters, as the request for light and entertaining content is clear and aligns with the identified show. Step 5 - The intent is clear, and the content has been verified as appropriate for the user's request. Step 6 - There is no doubt or ambiguity present.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is clear, the device is specified, and the content has been verified as suitable for the user's request.",
