  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command is a device control request, not an information request. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` does not contain `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` or `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`, but the lack of a specific game or team preference indicates a gap in parameters. Step 3 - The command refers to a specific TV, the Samsung 8 Series (82), which is clear, so no ambiguity in device reference. Step 4 - The required parameter of which game to put on the TV is missing, indicating a need for clarification. Step 5 - The intent is to control a device, but the lack of specific content leads to uncertainty in execution. Step 6 - Given the missing parameter and the need for clarity, I conclude that human interaction is necessary.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command lacks a specific game or team preference, which is essential for executing the request accurately. Clarification is required to proceed.",
