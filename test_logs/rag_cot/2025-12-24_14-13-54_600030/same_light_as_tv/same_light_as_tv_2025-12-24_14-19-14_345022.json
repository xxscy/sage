  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command is a device control request, not an information request. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, which is a mandatory marker indicating the need for clarification. Step 3 - There is a singular reference (\"the light\") while multiple light devices exist, confirming the need for clarification. Step 4 - The command does not specify which light to turn on, indicating a missing required parameter. Step 5 - The intent is to control a device, but due to the ambiguity and lack of specificity, further verification is necessary. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the need for clarification, I conclude that human interaction is required.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command to turn on the light is ambiguous due to multiple light devices being present and the lack of specification on which light to control.

Target device is AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE.\n- **Confidence**: Low (Unverified Content/Ambiguous Target)\n- **Reasoning**: The command to turn on the light was made while the TV is on, indicating the light should be activated in the same room. However, there are multiple active light strips, and the command does not specify which one to control, leading to an ambiguous target situation. Therefore, the target device is marked as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE.",
