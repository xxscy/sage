Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` since there are multiple instances of the meross-Light-Strip. Therefore, I **Need** clarification. Step 3 - There is no singular reference used in the command, but the presence of multiple devices creates ambiguity. Step 4 - The required parameter (the specific instance of the bedroom light) is missing due to the ambiguity. Step 5 - The intent is clear, but the ambiguity in device identification requires further clarification. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the need for specificity, I **Need** to ask for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command involves an ambiguous device reference (multiple instances of the meross-Light-Strip), which requires clarification to ensure the correct device is controlled.",
