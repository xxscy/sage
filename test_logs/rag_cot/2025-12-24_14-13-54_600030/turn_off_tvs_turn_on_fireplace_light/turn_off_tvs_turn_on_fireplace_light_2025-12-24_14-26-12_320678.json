  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command does not request information, so I proceed to the next step. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER` for the fireplace light, which is a mandatory marker indicating a need for clarification. Step 3 - There is no singular reference with multiple candidates for the fireplace light, so I do not need to check this. Step 4 - The command lacks specific parameters for controlling the fireplace light, which is marked as UNKNOWN_PARAMETER. Step 5 - The intent is to control devices, but due to the ambiguity regarding the fireplace light, I must seek clarification. Step 6 - Given the presence of an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER and the lack of verified content for the fireplace light, I conclude that I need to ask for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command includes an ambiguous reference to the fireplace light, which lacks verified control information, necessitating clarification to ensure accurate execution.",
