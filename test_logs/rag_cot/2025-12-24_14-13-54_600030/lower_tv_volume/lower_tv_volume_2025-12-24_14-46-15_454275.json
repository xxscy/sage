Step 3 - There is ambiguity in the target device since there are two TVs present, making it unclear which one to control. Step 4 - The required parameter for the volume adjustment is missing, as the user did not specify how much to lower the volume. Step 5 - The intent is to lower the volume of a TV, but due to the ambiguities identified, I cannot confidently execute the command. Step 6 - Given the uncertainties, I must seek clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to the lack of a specified volume level and the presence of multiple TVs, which prevents me from accurately executing the request.",

The device state indicates that the volume is currently set to 6 on the Samsung The Frame TV, but without a specified amount to lower it by, I cannot determine the exact action to take. Therefore, I marked the volume adjustment as `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`. Additionally, there are two TVs present, which makes the target device ambiguous, so I cannot specify which TV to control.",
