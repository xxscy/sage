The device lookup results indicated that the Samsung The Frame (49) TV is currently on, so no action is needed to turn it on. The other TV (Samsung 8 Series) is off, but since the command was to turn on the TV, I specified the active device. No content consumption request was made, so no verification against the TV Guide was necessary.",
