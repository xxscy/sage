  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it is a command to control a device. Step 2 - Classify Intent: The intent is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` specifies turning on a light by the bed, but it does not identify which specific light among multiple options. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since there are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices and the command does not specify which one, I must ask for clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required due to the ambiguity in targeting the specific light.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is ambiguous as it does not specify which light to turn on among multiple options.",

The device lookup results showed multiple meross-Light-Strip devices, but since the user did not specify which one, I selected the first available one. The command is straightforward as the user did not provide a specific color or intensity preference, and no historical preferences were found. Therefore, I used the default action of turning on the light without additional parameters.",
