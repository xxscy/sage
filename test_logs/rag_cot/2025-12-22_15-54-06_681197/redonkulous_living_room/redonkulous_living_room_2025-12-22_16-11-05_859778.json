  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it seeks to change the state of a device. Step 2 - Classify Intent: The intent is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` suggests setting the meross-Light-Strip to a vibrant color with a brightness level of 70, but it lacks a specific color or style. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command is ambiguous regarding the color, I must ask for clarification as there is no safe default for the color. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required due to the ambiguity in the command.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is ambiguous regarding the specific color to set for the lighting, necessitating clarification.",

The meross-Light-Strip is identified as the active device for lighting control, but without a specific color or style, I applied a conservative default brightness level of 70, which is the current state of one of the active light strips. However, the lack of a specific color or style makes the command ambiguous.",
