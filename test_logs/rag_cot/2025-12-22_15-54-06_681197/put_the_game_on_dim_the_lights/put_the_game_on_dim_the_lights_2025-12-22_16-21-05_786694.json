  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it involves device control and content consumption. Step 2 - Classify Intent: The command is classified as Device Control since it involves dimming lights and putting a game on the TV. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates an attempt to dim the lights but lacks a specific game or channel reference, leading to an UNKNOWN_CHANNEL status. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Logic 1 applies for the content aspect, which cannot proceed due to the lack of a verified source. Logic 2 applies for the device control aspect, where the target TV is ambiguous, requiring clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required due to the ambiguous target for the TV and the unverified game/channel.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command lacks a specific game or channel reference and the target TV is ambiguous, necessitating user clarification.",

The lights can be dimmed, but since the user did not specify a preference for the light level, a conservative default of 50% was applied. The target TV is ambiguous as there are multiple TVs, and no specific one was identified for the game.",
