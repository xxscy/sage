Step 2 - Classify Intent: The intent is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates turning on the TV and switching to an unknown channel, as no specific game or channel was provided. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command does not specify a game or channel, I cannot verify a specific source, which leads to ambiguity. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required due to the lack of a specific game or channel.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command lacks a specific game or channel, making it ambiguous and requiring clarification.",
