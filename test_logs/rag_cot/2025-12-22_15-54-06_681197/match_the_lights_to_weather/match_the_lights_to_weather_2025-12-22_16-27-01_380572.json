Step 2 - Classify Intent: The intent is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is to set the light over the dining table to yellow, which is a clear action. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command specifies a single target (the light over the dining table) and the user has a verified preference for yellow light, I can proceed without needing further clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command is straightforward and does not require additional input.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is clear and actionable, with a specific target and a verified user preference for the light color.",
