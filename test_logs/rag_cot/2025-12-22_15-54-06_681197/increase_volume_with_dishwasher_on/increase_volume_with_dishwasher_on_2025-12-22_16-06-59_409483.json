Step 2 - Classify Intent: The request is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` specifies increasing the volume of the TV to a safe default level of 10 whenever the dishwasher is running. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command involves a condition (the dishwasher running) and specifies a clear action (increase volume of the TV), it can be executed without ambiguity. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command is clear and actionable based on the current state of the devices.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies a clear action to be taken based on the state of the dishwasher, and a safe default volume level has been applied for the TV.",

The TV is identified as the Samsung The Frame (49), which is currently on with a volume of 6. Since the user did not specify a personal preference for the volume level, I applied a conservative default increase to 10. The dishwasher is currently off, but the command is structured to activate when it is running. No verifiable content was found in the TV Guide, so the command focuses solely on device control.",
