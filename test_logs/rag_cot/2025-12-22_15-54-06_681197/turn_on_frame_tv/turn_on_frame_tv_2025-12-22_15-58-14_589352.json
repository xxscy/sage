  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it is a command to control a device. Step 2 - Classify Intent: The intent is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates turning on the TV to an `UNKNOWN_CHANNEL`, as there is no verified match for Channel 5. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command specifies a channel that is not verified, I must ask for clarification regarding the channel. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Clarification is required due to the ambiguity of the channel.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies turning on the TV to Channel 5, but the channel is marked as UNKNOWN due to the lack of a verifiable source.",
