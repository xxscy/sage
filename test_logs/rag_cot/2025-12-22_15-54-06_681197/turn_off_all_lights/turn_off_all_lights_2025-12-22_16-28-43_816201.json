  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: This is not an information request; it is a command to change the state of lighting. Step 2 - Classify Intent: This is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates setting the meross-Light-Strip to level 20, which is a specific action. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since there is a clear target (meross-Light-Strip) and a reasonable default level (20) is inferred for darkening the house, I can proceed without needing clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed as intended without ambiguity.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command specifies a clear action to darken the house by setting the light level to a reasonable default, and there is no ambiguity in the target device.",

The current state of the available light strips shows levels of 70, 48, and 35. To darken the environment, I set the light level to a conservative default of 20, which is a reasonable level for dimming without specific user preferences available. The command is directed to the meross-Light-Strip, which is the only identified device capable of adjusting the light level.",
