Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates turning off lights with a switch level below 50, but this threshold is not verified against user preferences. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command specifies a relative change (turning off lights that are dim), and I can infer a conservative default of below 50 for dimness, I can proceed without needing clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed based on the inferred default.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command can be executed using a conservative default for dimness without requiring user clarification.",
