Identify which TV is \"by the plant.\" Since there are two TVs available, we need to clarify which one the user is referring to. \n2. If the user can specify which TV they mean, we can proceed with the next steps. If not, we will need to consider both TVs for any actions.\n3. If the user confirms the TV, we can then check if the TV is powered on. If it is not, we will use the `switch` capability to turn it on.\n4. After the TV is on, we can use capabilities like `mediaInputSource`, `mediaPlayback`, or `audioVolume` depending on what the user wants to do with the TV.\nPlanner notes: The user mentioned \"TV by the plant,\" but did not specify which TV they are referring to. There are two TVs available, and we need to clarify which one to interact with. Once we have that information, we can proceed with the appropriate actions based on the capabilities of the selected TV. If the user does not specify, we will have to consider both TVs for any commands. \n\n<FINISHED>",
