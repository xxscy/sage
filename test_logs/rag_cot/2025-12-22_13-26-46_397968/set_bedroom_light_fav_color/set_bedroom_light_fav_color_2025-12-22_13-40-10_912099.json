If any of the devices are not functioning properly, attempt to refresh them using the `refresh` capability.\n3. Once the devices are confirmed to be healthy, use the `switch` capability to turn on the desired light strip.\n4. Optionally, adjust the brightness using the `switchLevel` capability or change the color using the `colorControl` capability if the user requests specific settings.\nPlanner notes: Since the user mentioned \"bedroom light,\" it is assumed they are referring to one of the available light strip devices. There are multiple light strip devices available, so I will check the health of all of them first. If they are functioning, I will proceed to turn on the light. Further specifications on brightness or color can be addressed after confirming the device's status. If the user has a specific light strip in mind, further disambiguation would be needed. \n\n<FINISHED>",
