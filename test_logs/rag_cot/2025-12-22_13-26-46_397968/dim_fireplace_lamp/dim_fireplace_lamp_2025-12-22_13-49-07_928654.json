Dim the lights by adjusting the `switchLevel` capability on the relevant light strips to a lower level (e.g., 30% brightness).\nPlanner notes: Since the command is to dim the lights by the fireplace, I have included all available meross Light Strips as they are likely to be the devices controlling the lights in that area. The `switch` capability will ensure the lights are on before adjusting the brightness with the `switchLevel` capability. If there are multiple light strips, I will apply the dimming action to all of them to ensure the desired effect. Further disambiguation may be needed if the user specifies which light strip to control. \n\n<FINISHED>",

The current state of the lights was checked, and since the user prefers dim, warm temperature light, I applied a safe default of reducing the brightness to a third of the current level (70% to approximately 23%).
