  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - Check Information Request: The command is asking about the state of the fridge door, which qualifies as an information request. Step 2 - Classify Intent: The request is classified as Device Control since it involves checking the state of a device. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` specifies checking the fridge door state using the contact sensor, which is a valid action. Step 4 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 0, this is an information request, so it does not require further action. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Since the command is to check the state of the fridge door, it can be executed without needing clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is an information request about the fridge door state, which can be completed as-is without further interaction.",
