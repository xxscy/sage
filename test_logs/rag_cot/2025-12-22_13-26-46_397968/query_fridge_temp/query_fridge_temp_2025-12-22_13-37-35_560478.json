Step 2 - Classify Intent: The request is classified as Device Control since it involves checking the state of a device. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` is to check the current temperature of the refrigerator, which is straightforward. Step 4 - Apply Logic: According to Logic 0, this is an information request, so it does not require further action. Step 5 - Final Verdict: Since the command is a request for information about the refrigerator's current temperature, it is complete as-is.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command is an information request about the refrigerator's temperature, which can be fulfilled without further interaction.",
