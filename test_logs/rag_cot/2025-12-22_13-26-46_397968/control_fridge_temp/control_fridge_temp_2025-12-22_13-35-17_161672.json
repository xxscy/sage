Step 2 - Classify Intent: The intent is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` specifies a clear action to set the internal temperature of the refrigerator to a specific value (5 degrees Celsius). Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command is clear and specific, and the device context is known, I can proceed with the action without needing further clarification. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed as specified.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command to change the fridge temperature is clear and specific, allowing for direct execution without the need for additional interaction.",

The `temperatureMeasurement` capability will allow us to read the current temperature, and the `thermostatCoolingSetpoint` capability will allow us to adjust the temperature if needed. Further clarification from the user may be required to determine if they want to check the current temperature, set a new temperature, or both. \n\n<FINISHED>",
