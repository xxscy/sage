Step 2 - Classify Intent: The intent is classified as Device Control. Step 3 - Analyze Refinement: The `Refined Command` indicates a need to adjust the volume of the Samsung 8 Series TV to a lower level, which is a clear action. Step 4 - Apply Logic: Since the command specifies a direction (lower level) but not an exact value, I will apply a conservative default reduction in volume. Step 5 - Final Verdict: The command can be executed without needing further clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe command to adjust the volume is clear, and a conservative reduction can be applied without ambiguity.",
