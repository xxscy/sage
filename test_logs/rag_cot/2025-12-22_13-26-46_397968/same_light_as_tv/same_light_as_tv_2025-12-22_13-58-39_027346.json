If the health check is successful, turn on the light by using the switch capability on each of the light strip devices.\nPlanner notes: Since there are multiple light strip devices available, I will first perform a health check to ensure they are operational. After confirming their status, I will proceed to turn on the lights using the switch capability.

Since there are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices available, I will attempt to turn on the light using the first operational device.
