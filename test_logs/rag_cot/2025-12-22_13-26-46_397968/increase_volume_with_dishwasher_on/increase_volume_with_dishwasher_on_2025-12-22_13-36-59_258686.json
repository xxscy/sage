Identify which TV you want to control (Samsung The Frame or Samsung 8 Series). If both are present, further clarification is needed.\n2. If controlling the TV, use the following capabilities:\n   - To turn on the TV: Use the `switch` capability.\n   - To adjust the volume: Use the `audioVolume` capability.\n   - To mute the audio: Use the `audioMute` capability.\n   - To change the channel or input source: Use `tvChannel` or `mediaInputSource` capabilities.\n3. For the dishwasher, use the following capabilities:\n   - To check the operating state: Use `dishwasherOperatingState`.\n   - To execute a command (like starting or stopping): Use the `execute` capability.\n   - To refresh the status: Use the `refresh` capability.\nPlanner notes: Since the user mentioned both a TV and a dishwasher, I have listed both devices and their capabilities. However, it is unclear which specific actions the user wants to perform on each device. Further clarification is needed to determine the exact commands to execute for the TV and the dishwasher. If the user can specify which TV they are referring to and what actions they want to take, I can provide a more detailed plan. \n\n<FINISHED>",

The only active TV is the Samsung The Frame. The dishwasher is currently off, so the command cannot be executed at this moment. The volume increase is set to a conservative default of 1, as no explicit preference was provided. However, since the dishwasher is not running, the command is not actionable at this time.",
