Check the current state of the lights (using the `switch` capability).\n2. If the lights are off, turn them on (using the `switch` capability).\n3. Set the color temperature to a warm value (using the `colorTemperature` capability).\n4. Adjust the brightness to a lower level for a cozy setting (using the `switchLevel` capability).\n5. Optionally, set a specific color if desired (using the `colorControl` capability).\nPlanner notes: Since there are multiple light strip devices available, I will check the state of each one and turn them on if they are off. Then, I will set the color temperature to a warm value and adjust the brightness to create a cozy atmosphere. If you have a specific color in mind, please let me know, and I can include that in the plan. Further disambiguation may be needed if you want to specify which light strip to use. \n\n<FINISHED>",
