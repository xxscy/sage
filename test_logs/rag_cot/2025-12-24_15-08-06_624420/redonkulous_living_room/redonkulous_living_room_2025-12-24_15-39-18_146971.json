Would you like me to suggest some colorful lighting options or decor ideas to achieve that playful look?",
  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command does not request information retrieval, so I proceed to the next step. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, which is a mandatory marker indicating that I need clarification. Step 3 - There is a singular reference to \"the living room,\" but multiple meross-Light-Strip devices exist, confirming the need for clarification on which device to control. Step 4 - The command lacks specific parameters regarding the color or intensity of the desired appearance, which further necessitates clarification. Step 5 - The intent is to create a vibrant atmosphere, but without clear parameters or device identification, I cannot execute the command accurately. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and lack of specific parameters, I conclude that I need to seek clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to multiple meross-Light-Strip devices and missing specific parameters for the desired appearance, requiring clarification to proceed accurately.",

AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The user requested to make the living room look \"redonkulous,\" which implies a desire for a vibrant and fun atmosphere. However, there are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices available, leading to ambiguity in identifying which specific device to control. Therefore, I marked the target as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. Additionally, there are no specific preferences or parameters provided for the color or intensity, which prevents me from executing a precise command.",
