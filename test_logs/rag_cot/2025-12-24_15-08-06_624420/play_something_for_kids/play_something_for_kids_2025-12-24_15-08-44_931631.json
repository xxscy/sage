Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` since there are two TVs available, making it mandatory to seek clarification.

Step 4 - There are no missing parameters in the command, as the user specified the content and the context. Step 5 - The intent is clear, but the ambiguity regarding which TV to use leads to low confidence. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the need for clarification, I must proceed to ask for more information.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command specifies a TV by the plant, but there are two TVs available, leading to ambiguity about which device to use.

The only verified source for kids' content is Channel 3 PBS Kids, which features Sesame Street. However, the specific TV device is ambiguous as there are two TVs available: Samsung The Frame (49) and Samsung 8 Series (82). Since the command implies a singular target but multiple devices exist, I marked the target as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. Therefore, the command cannot specify which TV to use, leading to a low confidence rating.",
