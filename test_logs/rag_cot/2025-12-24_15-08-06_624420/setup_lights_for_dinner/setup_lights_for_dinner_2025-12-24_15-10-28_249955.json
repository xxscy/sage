AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The command to set up lights for dinner suggests a need for a warm and inviting atmosphere. However, there are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices available, which creates ambiguity regarding which device to control. Therefore, I marked the target as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. Additionally, while I suggested a dimming level of 50%, this is an inferred value since no specific preference was provided by the user, and the user's preferences/history do not specify a typical setting for dinner lighting.",
