AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The command to \"darken the entire house\" implies a need to adjust the lighting levels. However, there are multiple light strips available, and the request does not specify which one to control. Therefore, the target device is marked as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. Additionally, there are no specific preferences for the dimming level, and since the user did not provide a personal preference that can be verified, I cannot specify a precise dimming level. Thus, the command is issued to dim all lights to a low level, but the ambiguity in device selection leads to a low confidence rating.",

UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for user preferences.\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The command specifies changing the refrigerator's internal temperature, which is a device control request. The device is identified as a Samsung refrigerator, but there is no historical data or user preferences regarding the temperature settings. Therefore, the command includes an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER marker for the user's preferences. The command does not contain any ambiguity regarding the device, but the lack of preference data affects the confidence level.",

Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the need for clarification, I conclude that I need to ask for more information.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous because it does not specify which of the two available TVs to turn on, and there are no additional parameters provided to clarify the request.",

Step 4 - The command lacks specific parameters such as color or brightness preferences, which are important for accurate execution. Step 5 - The intent is to control a device, but due to the ambiguity and lack of specific parameters, I cannot proceed confidently. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the need for clarification, I conclude that human interaction is necessary.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to multiple identical devices being present, and there are missing parameters regarding the light's color or brightness preferences. Clarification is required to ensure the correct device is controlled.",

Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`, which indicates a mandatory need for clarification. Step 3 - There is no singular reference to a device, so this step is not applicable. Step 4 - The user's preference regarding bringing an umbrella is missing, which is a required parameter for making a recommendation. Step 5 - The intent is to determine whether to bring an umbrella, but without knowing the user's preferences or the weather conditions, I cannot provide a confident answer. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and lack of necessary information, I conclude that I need to ask for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command involves a decision about bringing an umbrella, but there is insufficient information regarding the user's preferences and the weather conditions. Therefore, I need to clarify these points before providing a recommendation.",
