Step 4 - There are no missing parameters in this case, as the user's favorite team is known.

Marked as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE due to multiple light strips available.\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The command involves changing the state of multiple light strips to represent a specific hockey team. The user's favorite team is verified as the Montreal Canadiens. However, there are multiple light strips identified, and the command refers to them in a singular manner (\"the lights\"), which creates ambiguity. Therefore, the command is marked as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. No specific channel or content consumption request is present, so no content verification is applicable.",
