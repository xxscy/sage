  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command is not an information request; it is a request to perform an action. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` does not contain `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` or `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`, so no mandatory need arises from this check. Step 3 - The command specifies a TV by location (\"the tv by the credenza\"), which implies a singular reference. However, since there are two TVs, I need to confirm which one the user is referring to. Step 4 - There are no missing parameters in the command, as the channel is specified. Step 5 - The intent is clear, but the device reference is ambiguous due to the presence of multiple TVs. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity regarding which TV to use, I need to seek clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command references a TV by location, but there are multiple TVs in the home. To ensure accuracy, I need to confirm which TV the user intends to use.",
