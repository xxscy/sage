AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The command to \"turn on all the lights\" implies a singular reference to a light device. However, there are multiple active light strips available, which creates ambiguity. Therefore, I marked the command with AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. There is no specific channel or source to verify, and the user’s preference for dim, warm temperature light is noted but not applicable to this command since it does not specify a preference for the light state.",
