  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command does not request information, so I proceed to the next step. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains both `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` (multiple TVs) and `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER` (specific game not provided), which means I need to ask for clarification. Step 3 - There is a singular reference to \"the TV,\" but since there are multiple TVs, this creates ambiguity regarding which one to use, confirming the need for clarification. Step 4 - The command lacks a specific game title, which is a required parameter, further necessitating clarification. Step 5 - The intent is to control devices, but due to the ambiguities, I cannot proceed without additional information. Step 6 - Given the uncertainties, I conclude that I need to ask for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to multiple TVs being present and the specific game not being identified, which prevents accurate execution of the request.",

UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for the specific game.\"\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The command involves controlling a TV and lights. However, the specific game to be put on the TV is not provided, leading to an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for the game. Additionally, there are multiple TVs available, which creates ambiguity regarding which TV to use, thus marking it as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. Since the command cannot be executed without resolving these ambiguities, the confidence is low.",
