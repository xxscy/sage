Step 4 - The command does not include any specific parameters or preferences regarding the channel, which means I need to ask for clarification.

Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the need for clarification, I must proceed with caution.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command lacks specificity regarding which TV the user is referring to and does not provide a specific channel, leading to ambiguity that requires clarification.",

The device state indicates that the Samsung 8 Series TV is currently on Channel 42, but without a direct request for that channel or a specific source, I cannot confirm it as the answer. Therefore, I mark the channel as UNKNOWN_CHANNEL. Additionally, there are two TVs present, which introduces ambiguity regarding which TV the user is referring to, but since the command does not specify a device, I cannot mark it as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE.",
