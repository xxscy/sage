Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, which is a mandatory marker indicating ambiguity. Step 3 - The command refers to a light by the nightstand, but there are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices, leading to ambiguity in which specific light to control. Step 4 - There are no missing parameters, but the ambiguity in device selection remains. Step 5 - The intent is to control a device based on the state of another device, but the ambiguity in the light device prevents a clear action. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the presence of the mandatory marker, clarification is needed.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command involves multiple meross-Light-Strip devices, creating ambiguity about which specific light to turn on.

AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE.\"\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The command involves turning on a light, which is a device control request. The user specified a light by the nightstand, but there are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices available, leading to ambiguity. The dishwasher is currently off, and there is no specific preference or historical command related to the light's operation. Therefore, the command is marked with AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE due to the multiple instances of the light strip.",
