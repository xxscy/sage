Step 2 - The `Refined Command` does not contain `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` or `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER`, so this check is not applicable. Step 3 - There is no singular reference to a device; the command explicitly mentions \"the dishwasher,\" so this check is not applicable. Step 4 - The command lacks specific parameters or preferences for starting the dishwasher, which are necessary to ensure the command aligns with the user's expectations. Step 5 - The intent is clear, but due to the absence of user preferences or historical data, confidence in executing the command is low. Step 6 - Given the lack of specific parameters and the need for user preferences, I must seek clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command to start the dishwasher is clear, but there are no specific user preferences or historical data available to confirm how the user wants the dishwasher to operate.
