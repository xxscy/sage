However, there is no specific preference-related query that can be directly inferred from this command alone. \n\nIf you need to know more about Abhisek's preferences regarding lighting or devices, please provide additional context or specify the device in question.",
  "reasoning": "Reasoning: Step 1 - The command does not request information, so I proceed to the next step. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, which is a mandatory marker indicating that clarification is needed. Step 3 - There is a singular reference (\"it\") with multiple devices (two light strips and a switch), confirming the need for clarification. Step 4 - There are no specific parameters or preferences provided by the user, which further supports the need for clarification. Step 5 - The intent is to control a device, but due to the ambiguity, I cannot proceed without additional information. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the need for clarification, I conclude that human interaction is necessary.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command \"Turn it off\" is ambiguous as it does not specify which device to turn off, and there are multiple active devices. Clarification is required to ensure the correct device is controlled.",

AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The command \"Turn it off\" does not specify which device to turn off. There are multiple devices available: two meross Light Strips (both currently on) and a c2c-switch (currently off).
