Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains both `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE` (multiple meross-Light-Strip devices) and `UNKNOWN_PARAMETER` (specific brightness level not provided), which means I need to ask for clarification. Step 3 - There is ambiguity regarding which specific device to adjust since there are multiple meross-Light-Strip devices. Step 4 - The user's preferred brightness level is not specified, leading to a gap in required parameters. Step 5 - The intent is to adjust the brightness, but due to the ambiguity and missing parameters, I cannot proceed without further information. Step 6 - Given the low confidence and the presence of ambiguity, I need to ask for clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command contains ambiguity regarding which specific meross-Light-Strip to adjust and lacks a specified brightness level, necessitating clarification from the user.",
