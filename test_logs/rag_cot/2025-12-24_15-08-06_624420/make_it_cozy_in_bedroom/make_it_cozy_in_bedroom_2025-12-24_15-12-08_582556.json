Step 4 - The subjective descriptor \"cozy setting\" cannot be objectively mapped to specific parameters, confirming a need for clarification. Step 5 - The intent is to control the lights, but the lack of clarity on what \"cozy\" means in terms of light settings necessitates further inquiry. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the presence of an unknown parameter, I conclude that clarification is required.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command includes an UNKNOWN_PARAMETER for specific light settings, and the subjective nature of \"cozy setting\" cannot be accurately interpreted without further input from the user.",
