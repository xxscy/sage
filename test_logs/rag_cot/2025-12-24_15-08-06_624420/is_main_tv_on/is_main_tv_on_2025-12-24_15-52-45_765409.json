However, the context indicates a need for clarification. Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, which is a mandatory marker indicating that clarification is needed. Step 3 - There is a singular reference to \"the TV by the credenza,\" but there are two TVs identified, creating ambiguity about which TV is being referred to. Step 4 - There are no missing parameters in this case, but the ambiguity regarding which TV is being referenced is significant. Step 5 - The intent is to check the power state of a device, but due to the ambiguity, I cannot proceed without clarification. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and the presence of the mandatory marker, I must seek clarification.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous due to the presence of multiple TVs, and it is unclear which one the user is referring to as \"the TV by the credenza.\" Therefore, I need to ask for clarification before proceeding.",
