AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The command to \"darken the entire house\" implies a need to adjust the lighting levels. However, there are multiple light strips available, and the request does not specify which one to control. Therefore, the target device is marked as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. Additionally, there are no specific preferences for the dimming level, and since the user did not provide a personal preference that can be verified, I cannot specify a precise dimming level. Thus, the command is issued to dim all lights to a low level, but the ambiguity in device selection leads to a low confidence rating.",
