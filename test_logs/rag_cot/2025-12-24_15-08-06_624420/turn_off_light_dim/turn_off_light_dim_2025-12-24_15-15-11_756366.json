Step 2 - The `Refined Command` contains `AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE`, indicating that there is ambiguity regarding which lights are considered \"dim.\" Step 3 - There is no singular reference to a specific light, and multiple lights exist, confirming the ambiguity. Step 4 - The command lacks specific parameters to identify which lights are dim, leading to further uncertainty. Step 5 - The intent is to control devices, but due to the ambiguity in identifying the dim lights, I cannot execute the command confidently. Step 6 - Given the ambiguity and lack of clarity, I conclude that human interaction is necessary.\n\nConclusion:\nNeed to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason: The command is ambiguous because it does not specify which lights are dim, and there are multiple lights with varying brightness levels.

However, the specific lights that are dim are not identifiable from the provided data.\n- **Content Verification**: No verifiable match found\n- **Refined Command**: Turn off all the lights that are dim. AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE\n- **Confidence**: Low\n- **Reasoning**: The user requested to turn off all dim lights, but there are multiple lights with varying brightness levels (20 and 90). Since the command implies a singular action on dim lights but multiple candidates exist, I marked the target as AMBIGUOUS_DEVICE. There is no specific information on which lights are dim, leading to the conclusion that the command cannot be executed with certainty.",
