The previous command to dim the lights in the living room suggests a preference for a darker environment, reinforcing the idea that the user enjoys lower light levels.\n\nStep 3 - Information gap analysis: The command does not specify which devices should be darkened or to what extent. However, given the user's previous preference for dimming lights, it can be inferred that they want all lights to be dimmed to a comfortable level, likely similar to the living room dimming.\n\nStep 4 - Ambiguity resolution: While there is some ambiguity regarding which specific devices to darken, the context suggests that the user intends for all lights to be affected. This can be reasonably inferred from their previous behavior and the nature of the command.\n\nStep 5 - Decision: Do not need to use human_interaction_tool.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not need to use human_interaction_tool\n\nReason:\nThe user's intent to darken the entire house can be inferred from their previous preferences, and the ambiguity regarding specific devices can be reasonably resolved by assuming all lights should be dimmed.\n```",
